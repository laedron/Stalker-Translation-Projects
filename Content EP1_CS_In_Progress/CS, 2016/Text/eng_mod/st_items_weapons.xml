The penetrator is made from hardened tool-grade steel and usually separates from the jacket when hitting armor plate or other hard barriers: the penetrator goes inside the target while the jacket remains outside of the barrier/armor plate. When hitting soft armor or body tissue, the SP-6 bullet normally stays intact, thus ensuring conformity with international conventions on warfare. Penetration for the SP-6 cartridge is usually listed as 7-8 mm of mild steel at 100 meters, or "guaranteed penetration of Class Three body armor at 400 meters."</text>

		<text>he 7.62x51mm NATO FMJ is a rifle cartridge developed in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among NATO countries. The 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge was introduced to military service in rifles and machine guns. It was introduced in U.S. service in the M14 Rifle and M60 Machine gun in the late 1950s. Fabrique Nationale's FAL became the most popular 7.62mm NATO rifle in Europe and served well into the early 1980s. The M14 was superseded in U.S. service as the infantry adopted the 5.56x45mm M16. However, the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62x51mm round remain in service, especially in the case of sniper rifles and machine guns. The round is used by infantry and from ground vehicles, aircraft and ships. While similar in appearance, the military 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge is not identical to the commercial .308 Winchester. However, their interchange is not listed as unsafe in either combination. Some confuse the round with the 7.62x39mm intermediate cartridge used in the AK-47/AKM and other weapons, because both may be referred to simply as "7.62". They are not interchangeable.</text>

\nThe 9A-91 is a carbine assault rifle currently in use with Russian police forces. It is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilizes a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The receiver is made from steel stampings; the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel buttstock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The charging handle is welded to the right side of bolt carrier. The safety / fire selector lever is located at the left side of the receiver, above the trigger guard, and allows for semi- and full-automatic fire. The flip-up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 meters range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet effectively restricts the 9A91 to ranges of about 100 meters.</text>

\nThe Stechkin APS is a Russian selective fire machine pistol. It bears the name of its developer, Igor Stechkin. The Stechkin automatic pistol was originally chambered for 7.62×25mm Tokarev. Stechkin changed the pistol to the 9 mm caliber used in the new Makarov pistol, as it became clear that this cartridge was set to become the new service ammunition for handguns of the Soviet Army. In 1951, both the Makarov and Stechkin were introduced into the Soviet military arsenal, replacing the aging TT-33.

\nThe AN-94 "Abakan" is an advanced Russian assault rifle. The Russian Government formally declared the AN-94 to be the successor & replacement to the legendary Kalashnikov series of rifles following the Project Abakan advanced assault rifle trials in the USSR throughout the 1980s. Gennadiy Nikonov's system reportedly outperformed its many remarkable rivals significantly, proving better than the AEK-971 and the AKB-1. The Nikonov AN-94 was commissioned for general issue to the Soviet armed forces, with mass production to be carried out by the historic Izhmash state factories. At present the AN-94 is only issused in limited quantities to the elite forces of the Russian Army, police and Internal Affairs Ministry due to its rather complicated design, production cost and the cost related to training in achiving its effective use in combat. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute rate of fire. The Nikonov mechanism fires the second shot in the burst quickly enough to allow it to escape before the recoil of the first shot is felt, thus potentially allowing the two shots to hit extremely close together, for example to aid in piercing body armor.</text>

\nThe AEK-971 assault rifle was developed at Kovrov Machinebuilding Plant (formerly known as Kovrov Machineguns Plant) by chief designer S.I. Koksharov. Originally designed and tested during the 'Abakan' trials of the late 1980s, it failed in the trials, but its development was continued in hopes to sell the gun to police forces and for export. During the early 2000s small batches of AEK-971 rifles in 5.45x39 caliber were manufactured for Russian MVD troops, but has since then seen extremely limited production. Based on previous AK rifles in internal design and layout, the AEK-971 is also equipped with a recoil-balancing mechanism by way of a counter-weight that negates the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier, resulting in more controllable automatic fire.</text>

\nThe Kalashnikov AK-12 assault rifle is the newest creation of the IZMASH factory. It is intended to replace in production older Kalashnikov AK-74M and AK-100-series rifles for domestic use, as well as for export. The AK-12 assault rifle is a gas operated, selective fire weapon using traditional “Kalashnikov type” action with long stroke gas piston and rotary bolt locking. The Bolt group is noticeably lightened to decrease recol and improve accuracy in full-automatic fire. Barrel has improved rifling for better accuracy, and a revised muzzle brake. The receiver is redesigned, key modification being new top cover of more rigid design. Elongated top cover is removably attached to the receiver using two dovetails plus a captive cross-pin at the rear. The rifle comes standard with pictanny rails and an adjustable telescoping stock.</text>

\nThe AK is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations. Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG44. The Kalashnikov assault rifle, also known to the West as the AK-47, and its derivatives, also known under the common name of AK, is a selective-fire, gas-operated 7.62×39 assault rifle and by far the most prolific small arm of the 2nd half of the XX century. It had been and still is (in more or less modified form) manufactured in dozens of countries, and has been used in hundreds of conflicts since its introduction.</text>

\nIn 1991 the Izhmash factory in the city of Izhevsk began production of an improved variant of the AK-74 - the AK-74M assault rifle. Apart from several minor production improvements the rifle also features a new synthetic stock made from a black, glass-filled polyamide that is shaped like the AK-74 fixed stock, but also folds like in the AKS-74. Additionally the AK-74M uses a reinforced muzzle device and dust cover. Each AK-74M is fitted with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics. The AK-74M has been accepted as the new service rifle of the Russian Federation.</text>

\nThe AKM is a 7.62mm assault rifle designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is an upgraded version of the AK-47 rifle and was developed in the 1950's. Introduced into service with the Red Army in 1959, the AKM is the most ubiquitous variant of the entire AK series of firearms and it has found widespread use with most member states of the former Warsaw Pact and its many African and Asian allies. The production of Soviet rifles was carried out at both the Tula Arsenal and Izhevsk Mechanical Works.</text>

\nThe main variant of the AKM is the AKMS, which was equipped with an under-folding metal shoulder stock in place of the fixed wooden stock. The metal stock of the AKMS is somewhat different from the folding stock of the previous AK-47 model as it has a modified locking mechanism, which locks both support arms of the AKMS stock instead of just one (left arm) as in the AK-47 folding model.</text>

\nUnlike the AKMS, the AKS-74 stock has a triangular shape and lacks the folding shoulder pad of the AKMS (which increases the stock's rigidity) and is folded to the left side of the receiver. The hinged stock is securely locked in place in its extended position by a latch mechanism at the rear of the receiver. The latch release button is located on the left side of the receiver. When folded, the stock is held by a spring-loaded capture in the forward barrel trunnion. A rear sling swivel is also provided and placed on the right side of the lower stock frame.</text>

\nIn 1979 a shortened variant of the AKS-74 was adopted into service – the AKS-74U carbine, which in terms of tactical deployment, bridges the gap between a submachine gun and assault rifle. It is intended for use mainly with special forces, airborne infantry, rear-echelon support units and armored vehicle crews. The weapon's compact dimensions, compared to the AKS-74, were achieved by using a short, 210 mm (8.3 in) barrel (this forced designers to simultaneously reduce the gas piston operating rod to an appropriate length). A new gas block was installed at the muzzle end of the barrel and a new conical flash hider was used. The AKS-74U is significantly more maneuverable in tight quarters than the AKS-74, however the steep decline in muzzle velocity from 900 m/s (2,953 ft/s) to 735 m/s (2,411 ft/s) resulted in a decrease in effective aimed range.</text>

It is intended for use mainly with special forces, airborne infantry, rear-echelon support units and armored vehicle crews. The weapon's compact dimensions, compared to the AKS-74, were achieved by using a short, 210 mm (8.3 in) barrel (this forced designers to simultaneously reduce the gas piston operating rod to an appropriate length). In order to effectively stabilize projectiles, the barrel's twist rate was reduced from 200 mm (7.9 in) to 160 mm (6.3 in). A new gas block was installed at the muzzle end of the barrel and a new conical flash hider was used, which features an internal expansion chamber that alleviates gas pressure generated during firing. The flash suppressor locks into the gas block with a latch placed on the right side. The forward sling loop was relocated to the left side. The weapon's front sight is integrated into the gas block base.\n\n The AKS-74U also has a different sight system setup with a U-shaped flip sight instead of the standard sliding notch sight. The rear sight has two settings: "P" (fixed for firing at 350 m) and "4-5" (used for firing at distances up to 400-500 m). The rear sight is housed in a semi-hooded shroud that is riveted to the receiver top cover. This top cover is connected with the gas tube cover and is hinged, pivoting forward when opened. Both the gas tube and hand-guard are also of a new type and are shorter than analogous parts in the AKS-74.\n\n The AKS-74U is significantly more maneuverable in tight quarters than the AKS-74, however the steep decline in muzzle velocity from 900 m/s (2,953 ft/s) to 735 m/s (2,411 ft/s) resulted in a decrease in effective aimed range (the effective hitting distance for a "running"-type silhouette was reduced from 625 to 350 m). The carbine cannot mount a bayonet or standard under-barrel grenade launcher. However, a suppressed 30 mm BS-1 grenade launcher was developed for this weapon that fires high-explosive dual purpose (HEDP) grenades. The grenades from the BS-1 are launched by blank cartridges and the weapon is cycled manually in this mode of operation. The majority of AKS-74U's were manufactured at the Tula Arms Factory rather than Izhmash.</text>

\nThe Steyr AUG (Armee Universal Gewehr - Universal Army Rifle) had been in development since the late 1960s, as a replacement for venerable but obsolete Stg.58 (FN FAL). It was developed by the Austrian Steyr-Daimler-Puch company in close conjunction with Austrian Army. The major design is attributed to the three men - Horst Wesp, Karl Wagner and Karl Möser, who developed most of the rifle features. The new rifle has been adopted by the Austrian Army in 1977, as the Stg.77 (Assault rifle, model of 1977), and production began in 1978. Since then, the AUG gained serious popularity, being adopted by the armed forces of Australia, Austria, New Zealand, Oman, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Ireland and some others. It also was widely purchased by various security and law enforcement agencies worldwide, including the US Coastal Guard. The Steyr AUG can be considered as the most commercially successful bullpup assault rifle to date.</text>

\nIn early 1980-ies British Army started the search forthe replacement ofthe aging L42 Enfield sniper rifles. Main compettitors were Parker-Hale with their Model 82 bolt action rifle, and Accuracy International, with their PM rifle. Eventually, the PM rifle won the competition and was accepted by the British Army under the designation of L96. One of the most notorious features of the PM rifle was the design of the stock. Instead of the solid polymer or wooden stock, PM/L96 rifle used a hollow polymer stock, made from two halves and assembled aroundaluminium bedding block, that extends through entire stock lenght. This line of rifles is among the best in the World of sniper rifles today.</text>

\nThe CZ-75 was developed in the Czech Republic by the Koucky brothers. This full-size semiautomatic pistol first appeared in 1975, and the production began circa 1976. The CZ-75 was intended for the export market. The CZ-75 accumulated best features from many preceding designs. The resulting pistol was aesthetically attractive, comfortable to handle and shoot, quite accurate and reliable in operation. Made by CZ in various versions and modifications, CZ-75 was also widely copied and cloned.</text>

\nThe Galil is an Israeli assault rifle, designed by Yisrael Galili under Israeli Military Industries in 1969. Its design is based on that of the Finnish RK 62 rifle, which in turn is derived from the Russian AK-47. It was adopted by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in 1972, beating out several other rifles and replacing the unreliable FN FAL. The Galil is noted for its reliability in combat conditions, and ease of maintenance.</text>

\nThe G3 is a battle rifle developed in the 1950s by the German armament manufacturer Heckler & Koch GmbH (H&K) in collaboration with the Spanish state-owned design and development agency CETME (Centro de Estudios Tйcnicos de Materiales Especiales). It is designed to use the 7.62x51 NATO round, and uses a Roller-delayed blowback action. The rifle owes its design to the CETME mod. A, which was designed by the german engineer Dr. Ludwig Vorgrimler. In 1957 Heckler & Koch bought the license to manufacture the rifle, where small modifications were made to the CETME design, and it was officially adopted into service in 1959, by the Bundeswehr as the G3, where it remained as the main service rifle until 1995 where it was replaced by the G36. Despite having been officially replaced by the German army, it is still in limited use. The G3 is also widely popular rifle among militaries all over the world, among a few nations that use it are Greece, Angola, Denmark, Iceland, Gabon, Lebanon, Iran, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Phillipines, Turkey, Turkey, and Sweden.</text>

\nThe FNX line of pistols were introduced in 2009 by FNH USA, a US-based subsidiary of the famous Belgian gun making company FN Herstal. Originally developed to the requirements of the US Joint Combat Pistol Program, these pistols are manufactured in the USA and intended for military, law enforcement and civilian use. All FNX handguns are semi-automatic pistols with double/single action trigger and external hammer. FNX pistols use modified Browning-type locking system with short recoiling barrel that tips down to unlock from the slide, using cam-shaped cut below the breech. Frame of the every FNX pistol is made from impact-resistant polymer,  with removable backstraps of different sizes. Barrel and slide are made from stainless steel. FNX pistols feature fully ambidextrous controls, including frame-mounted manual safety/decocker and slide release levers, as well as magazine release buttons. Ammunition is fed from double stack, single feed box magazines. FNX-45 Tactical is a specialized variant of the basic FNX-45, that features extended threaded barrel and raised sights, to be used with detachable sound suppressor.</text>

These trials were started by issuing initial requirements for a new military pistol in 1993. Several designs were submitted to the trials, but the eventual winner was the pistol designed at the state Izhevsk Mechanical Plant by Vladimir Yarygin. This pistol, initially known as the 6P35 (military index during trials) or the MP-443 "Grach" (manufacturer's designation), is now officially adopted by the Russian Government for Military and Law Enforcement use under the PYa designation, and already issued to some Russian Army units.</text>

\nOTs-33 "Pernach" (multivaned mace) is a recent entry into the small and very special class of automatic (machine) pistols, and is intended to replace obsolete Stechkin APS pistols in the hands of various special units in Russian police and other paramilitary units. Developed circa 1995-96 by the Igor Stechkin at the TSKIB SOO (central design bureau for sporting and hunting arms, Tula, Russia), the same designer who developed the APS, the OTs-33 is now in limited production by the KBP design bureau. OTs-33 has simplified "squared" shape and is much easier (and less expensive) to manufacture, as well as simpler in design. It is capable of fully automatic and semi-automatic fire, and can be fitted with a detachable folding shoulder stock, made of steel. It is in limited use with some OMON units in the Russian police force. Fixed sights have white inserts for improved visibility.</text>

\nThe GSh-18 is a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol developed in the early 1990s at the KBP Instrument Design Bureau in Tula. The pistol's name is derived from its designers - Gryazev and Shipunow, and the number 18 denotes the magazine capacity. The GSh-18 is a recoil-operated, locked breech pistol. The weapon has an unusual cam-rotated barrel with 10 locking lugs. The GSh-18 is striker-fired and features a pre-set trigger that pre-cocks the pistol when the slide recoils after firing a shot. The striker firing pin is then fully cocked by pulling the trigger back to the rear.</text>

\nInstead of adopting an existing design to meet the requirements, Gaston Glock, owner of a relatively small company Glock GmbH, called for the best designers and experts and asked them to create an ideal pistol. It was clear that the Austrian Army wanted a defensive pistol – simple, reliable, lightweight and inexpensive. The Glock team accordingly created what would be called the most utilitarian pistol of recent decades. The low weight was achieved by using a polymer frame – a solution probably borrowed from the Austrian Stg.77 (Steyr AUG) assault rifle, adopted in 1978. Simplicity of operation combined with a minimum number of parts were achieved by using patented “safe action” trigger system, which has no manual safeties.</text>

\nThe Glock 19 is a smaller pistol (defined as "compact") based on teh original Glock 17 with the new gun made easier to conceal for use by military and police forces. The pistol was debuted by Glock GbmH of Austria in 1988. When compared to the Glock 17, the Glock 19 retaind the wieght ot its slide to keep the short recoil operation in check while at teh same time shortening the grip and barrel. Many of the components of the Glock 19 were made interchangeable with the Glock 17 and this included teh magazine. Essentially, the Glock 19 was teh same design, just made more compact.</text>

\n]The Saiga-12 is a Kalashnikov-pattern 12 gauge combat shotgun available in a wide range of configurations. Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly. The rumored inaccuracy of Kalashnikov type guns is not an important shortcoming in a shotgun, a weapon rarely used beyond 50 yards. However, the loose and reliable design is an enormous boon on a semi-automatic shotgun, as this class of weapon had previously tended towards unreliability. The gun is also readily affordable and easy to maintain, made almost entirely from sheet-metal stampings.The Saiga-12 is manufactured by the arms division of Izhmash, in Russia. It was previously imported into the US by European American Armories, although their agreement expired in 2005 and Izhmash is now exporting through the Russian-American Armory Company.</text>

\nBetween 1906-1907, the U.S. Army announced trials to replace its service revolvers with a new, semi-automatic pistol. The Army required the new pistol to have the caliber of .45 inch, so Browning designed its own cartridge that fired a 230 grains (14.9 gram) bullet, and then, designed a new pistol. In 1911, after extensive testings, the new pistol and its cartridge, designed by Browning and manufactured by Colt, were adopted for U.S. military service as the M1911. Prior to and during World War One, more than one million of these pistols were manufactured, mostly by Colt and Springfield Armoury, as well as by Remington-UMC, Burroughs, Savage and some other companies. The rights to manufacture Colt/Browning design were also sold to some foreign countries, such as Norway or Argentine.In 1926, original design was improved, following the recommendations of the US Army Ordnanve Dept. These changes incorporate: a wider front sight, longer hammer spur, Shorter trigger, Curved spring housing, simplified grip panels checkering, index finger reliefs behind the trigger, and a longer grip-safety spur. The improved design was adopted by US Military as M1911A1 pistol, and served with distinction until the mid-1980-ies.</text>

In around 1996, Magnum Research, Inc. successfully introduced the .50 Action Express Desert Eagle Pistol to fill an unmet need in the sporting/hunting market. Today Desert eagle pistols are used for competitive shooting as well as for hunting and general plinking.</text>

\nFAMAS stands for Fusil d'Assaut de la Manufacture d'Armes de St-Etienne (Assault Rifle by St-Etienne Arms Factory - a member of the French govt. owned GIAT Industries concern). Development of this rifle began in 1967, under the leadership of the Paul Tellie, a French arms designer. This new rifle was intended to replace in service the MAS Mle.49/56 semi-automatic rifles, MAT-49 submachine guns and some MAC Mle.1929 light machine guns. The first FAMAS prototype had been built in 1971. French military began to test this rifle in 1972-73, but, in the meantime, France adopted a Swiss-designed SIG SG-540 5.56mm assault rifle as an intermediate solution. The FAMAS rifle was adopted by the French in 1978 and since then became a standard French Army shoulder fired small arm, known among the French soldiers as "Le Clairon"(the bulge).</text>

\nDuring the late 1980-ies and early 1990-ies famous Belgian company FN Herstal began the search for its next entry into the assault rifle world. The aim this time was to produce a modern, modular weapon, and this ultimately resulted in the FN F2000 rifle, which was first displayed in public in 2001. The F2000 offers all of the most popular features of the modern assault rifle, such as a compact bullpup layout, completely ambidextrous handling, and a modular design with plenty of options and add-ons already available, which allow the rifle to be “tailored” for any particular mission or tactical situation. So far the FN F2000 rifle found only a few buyers, including the Armed forces of Slovenia and Belgian Special operations forces. Nevertheless, it is one of most promising assault rifles on the market.</text>

\nThis interesting submachine gun had been developed in Izhevsk at the famous IZHMASH state arms factory during the early 1990s, and first appeared on public circa 1993. Obviously influenced by the somewhat unsuccessful Calico submachine guns, Bizon (Bison) SMG combined high capacity "helical"magazine with more conventional appearance and layout. Bizon submachine guns are built on shortened AKS-74 receivers, made from stamped steel. It featured a simple blowback action, hammer fired from closed bolt. Feed is from "helical" magazines, made mostly of plastic and mounted under the barrel. The design of those cylindrically shaped magazines are loosely based on American Calico designs. The Bizon is capable of semi-automatic and full automatic fire, with typical AK-typesafety - selector lever at the right side of the receiver. Sturdy skeletonized buttstock is made from stamped steel and folds to the left side when not needed.Sights are similar to ones found on the AKS-74U, with hooded front post and flip-up rear.</text>

\nThe FN P90 submachine gun (SMG) was developed in the late 1980s as a personal defense weapon for the troops whose primary activities does not include small arms, such as vehicle and tank crew members, artillery crews etc. Standard pistols and submachine guns chambered for pistol rounds were proved ineffective against enemy soldiers, wearing body armor; Therefore FN designers first developed a new round with enhanced penetration, initially known as SS90. To achieve necessary high penetration while keeping recoil impulse low, FN used a small-bore approach, creating a round that looked much like the scaled down 5.56 NATO round. Resulting weapon appeared in around 1990 as FN P90 personal defense weapon, along with improved 5.7x28 SS190 ammunition, which replaced polymer-cored bullets with heavier dual-core (steel / aluminum) bullets with better penetration against body armor. Several other types of ammunition were developed for this weapon, including tracer, subsonic ball and soft-core training ball.</text>

\nThe Fort 12 pistol is an attempt of the independent Ukraine (one of the former USSR republics) to develop its own police pistol to replace Soviet era, aging Makarov PM pistols. To accomplish this task, Ukrainian state-owned FORT factory purchased Czech machinery from CZ-Uhersky Brod factory, and by the late 1990s developed its first pistol, the Fort 12. Currently, this gun is issued to the Ukrainian police and security forces and also sold on civilian market chambered for non-lethal rubber ammunition or tear gas ammunition. Early production Fort 12 pistols were reported as only marginally reliable, but at the present time most of the teething problems are gone, and Fort 12 pistol provides some improvements over the older Makarov PM in the ergonomics, accuracy and magazine capacity.</text>

\nThe Fort 17 pistol is the latest development of the Ukrainian state-owned FORT factory. Basically, it is a polymer-framed modification of the earlier Fort 12 pistol, and all the mechanisms and properties are almost the same between these two pistols. However, the Fort 17 is lighter than its predecessor, and features a removable grip backstrap, which can be had in various sizes, to adopt the pistol for a particular shooter.</text>

\nThe Heckler und Koch G-36 assault rifle had been born as the HK-50 project in early 1990s. The reason behind that project was that the Bundeswehr (the German army), after the cancellation of the G11 and G41 projects, was left with outdated G3 rifles. Therefore the famous company Heckler & Koch was set to develop a new assault rifle for both the German army and for export. The new 5.56mm assault rifle was adopted by the Bundeswehr in the 1995. The G36 also found its way into the hands of various law enforcement agencies worldwide, including British police and some US police departments. So far, there have been very few complaints about this rifle. The more common ones being the overheating of the handguards during sustained fire, and the loose of zero on the built in scope of some G36KE rifles. Some German soldiers also complained about the position of the dual optical sights and those sights being easily fogged in bad weather. Otherwise it is a good rifle, accurate, reliable, simple in operations and maintenance</text>

\nFor those soldiers who need to work in tight spaces, the standard G36 setup was less than ideal. In order to give those special forces soldiers something truly special, H&K designed a shorter version of the G36 they dubbed the "C" or carbine version. The main changes are a drastically shortened barrel and a re-positioned gas block to keep the gun cycling even despite the shorter dwell time in the barrel. The gun is noticeably lighter by almost a full pound. The interiors of the gun are all steel, but the chassis is made out of a high strength polymer. This makes for a sleek looking firearm that is very light weight. The magazine sports a set of nubs on the exterior that are designed to slot into one another, and allow the shooter to tie multiple magazines together.</text>

\nA shortened variant of the G36 rifle with a shorter barrel (fitted with an open-type flash suppressor) and a shorter forend, which includes a bottom rail that can be used to attach tactical accessories, such as a UTL flashlight from the USP pistol. The carbine's barrel lacks the ability to launch rifle grenades and it will not support a bayonet. The weapon retained the ability to be used with the AG36 grenade launcher. G36Ks in service with German special forces are issued with a 100-round C-Mag drum. There are two variants of the G36K. The first and most commonly known has x3 scope/carry handle attached to the top, while the second is the one with the iron sights and rail.</text>

\nThe OTs-14 “Groza” (“thunder”) modular assault rifle was developed during the early 1990s at the TSKIB SOO. It was intended for various Special Forces in the Russian army and Internal Affairs Ministry as an dedicated CQB/Urban warfare weapon. It was briefly manufactured in small numbers at the Tula Arms factory during the mid-1990s. OTs-14 rifles saw some action during the first anti-terrorist campaign in Chechnya in 1999, but soon felt out of favor and are no longer made. The OTs-14 is based on the familiar AKS-74U receiver and action, modified for the larger 9 x 39 subsonic ammunition favored by various SpetsNaz troops. It is fitted into a bullpup layout, with removable trigger/pistol grip unit which could be replaced with an alternative unit integral with 40 mm grenade launcher. In the grenade-launching configuration, a single trigger controls both the 40 mm GL and the rifle itself, with a separate barrel selector. The safety/fire mode selector of AK pattern is retained and in bullpup configuration is especially uncomfortable to operate. The barrel can be fitted with a quick-detachable silencer. Standard open sights are built into the carrying handle, which results in relatively short sight base. The carrying handle also has mounting points for telescope, red dot or night sights.</text>

\nThe Browning Hi-Power is a single-action, 9 mm semi-automatic pistol. It is based on ideas conceived and patented in 1922 by American firearms inventor John Browning, and later patented by Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Herstal, Belgium. Browning died in 1926, before he had finished developing a production version. The design was fully developed and realized by Belgian arms designer Dieudonne Saive, working at FN.\n\n The Hi-Power pistol was named for its 13-round magazine capacity, which was almost twice that of contemporary designs such as the Luger or Mauser 1910. The Hi-Power had the first functional double-column magazine of 9 mm rounds, and was capable of holding 13 cartridges, with a 14th loaded in the chamber. Flush-fit 15 round magazines are now available, as well as higher capacity magazines which extend past the end of the butt.The pistol is often referred to as an HP (for "Hi-Power" or "High-Power") or as a GP (for the French term, "Grande Puissance"). The term P-35 is also used, based on the introduction of the pistol in 1935. Another common nickname is the "King of Nines." It is most often called the "Hi-Power", even in Belgium. This modified variant of the Browning HP pistol, despite its venerable age, retains a very high popularity around the world.</text>

\nThe HK416 is an assault rifle designed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch to be an improved version of the M4 Carbine pattern firearm. It is available as a complete firearm, or as an upper receiver kit that fits on any AR-15 type lower receiver. The US Army’s Delta Force collaborated with the German arms makers to develop the new carbine. It replaced its M4s with the H&K 416 in 2004 after tests revealed that the piston operating system significantly reduces malfunctions while increasing the life of parts. The project was originally called the HKM4, but this was changed in response to a trademark infringement suit filed by Colt Defense. It is speculated that "416" is a reference to the M4 and M16 it's designed to succeed. So far the weapon has reportedly been tested by the United States military as well as some law enforcement agencies. It is only available to government and military organizations currently.</text>

\nThe development of the SA80 system, which included two weapons - the SA80 IW assault rifle and SA80 LSW light machine gun, began in the late 1960s when Britisharmy decided to develop a new rifle, which will eventually replace the venerable 7.62mm L1 SLR (British-made FNFAL rifle) in the 1980s. When NATO trials were announced in 1977 to select a new cartridge, British state-owned Enfield Small Arms Factory developed its own small-caliber, high velocity round, which was more or less representing the US .223/5.56mm case necked down to accept 4.85mm (0.19 inch) bullet. When the cartridge came out, Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield developed a new weapon around it, initially designated as SA80-IW or XL65. Original SA80 weapons (both L85 and L86) were plagued with many problems, some being very serious. In general, the L85 was quite unreliable and troublesome to handle and maintain, so, finally, in the year 1997, after years of constant complaints from the troops, it had been decided to upgrade most L85 rifles then in service.  The current L85A2 rifles are recognized as reliable and very accurate, especially when using standard issue SUSAT telescope sights.</text>

\nThe LR-300 rifle was manufactured by the small US-based company Z-M Weapons between 2000 and 2007, when all rights for the design were sold to the Para USA, the US-based subsidiary of the Canadian pistol maker Para-Ordnance Ltd. The original LR-300 rifles were designed by Alan Zitta as an upgrade to the well known and popular M16/AR-15 rifles. In fact, LR-300 and Para TTR both use standard AR-15-typelower receivers; only upper receivers are different and contain patented modified gas system. The key reason for tha modification was to prowide AR-15-type weapon with capability to mount side-folding stock rather than partially collapsible M4 carbine-typestock. Z-M Weapons intended its rifles mostly for military and law enforcement personnel, by offering LR-300-ML weapons with short barrels and select-fire capability. Great ergonomics and lightweight, this weapon is highly accurate.  However, it is sensitive to dirt and is not ideal for difficult field conditions.</text>

\nThe MP-133 is a product of the Izhevsk Mechanical plant. This shotgun is an evolution of the earlier IZh-81 pump action shotgun, and is intended primary for civilian and security markets. It is produced in two basic versions (standard MP-133 with tubular magazine andMP-133K with detachable box magazine), and either version can be had in a variety of barrel lengths and styles, as well as in wooden or polymer furniture, with traditional fixed buttstock, side-folding (AK-74M type)polymer folding buttstock, or pistol grip and no buttstock. The MP-133 shotgun uses traditional pump action with sliding forend that has dual action bars. Locking is achieved by a tilting locking piece, which is installed in the bolt and engages the notch in the barrel extension when in battery. Feed is from tubular underbarrel magazine which holds 4 rounds (capacity can be enhanced byinstalling magazine extension tubes). The receiver of the MP-133 is made from aluminum alloy. Barrels can be easily removed, and available in a variety of lengths and styles (with ventilated ribs or with no rib and rifle-type sights). Barrels are equipped with interchangeable choke system. </text>

\nThe M4 Carbine descends from a family of firearms tracing its lineage back to earlier carbine versions of the M16, all based on the original AR-15 made by ArmaLite. It is a shorter and lighter version of the M16 style assault rifle, sharing 80% of its parts. The M4 and variants fire 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and are gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective fire firearms with a 4-position telescoping stock.As with many carbines, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full-length rifle. It has been adopted by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and is the preferred weapon of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs. The M4 is similar to much earlier compact M16 versions, such as the 1960s-era XM177 family.</text>

\nM16 (more formally Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16) is the U.S. military designation for a family of rifles derived from the ArmaLite AR-15 and further developed by Colt starting in the mid-20th century.The M16 rifle family including the M16/A1/A2/A3/A4 has been the primary infantry rifle of the United States military since the 1960s. With its variants, it has been in use by 15 NATO countries, and is the most produced firearm in its caliber. The M16 entered Army service in 1964.The M16 is a lightweight, 5.56 mm caliber, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle, with a rotating bolt, actuated by direct impingement gas operation. The rifle is made of steel, aluminum, and composite plastics.</text>

\nThe M16A2 rifle entered service in the 1980s, chambered to fire the standard NATO cartridge, the Belgian-designed M855/M856 cartridge. The M16A2 is a select-fire rifle (semi-automatic fire, three-round-burst fire) incorporating design elements requested by the Marine Corps: an adjustable, windage rear-sight; a stock 5/8-inch longer; heavier barrel; case deflector for left-hand shooters; and cylindrical hand guards.The fire mode selector is on the receiver's left side. The M16 rifle is principally manufactured by the Colt and the Fabrique Nationale de Herstal arms companies, with the variant rifles made elsewhere in the world.</text>

\nThe MP-5, is one of the most famous and wide-spread firearms of its class. Its development began circa 1964 under the company designation HK MP-54, or simply the HK 54. In 1966, German police and Border Guard adopted the HK 54 as the MP-5. Over the years the MP-5 was adopted by the huge numbers of police, security and military forces around the world. T MP-5 is still manufactured in Germany by HK itself, and also licensed to Greece,Iran, Pakistan and Mexico. The only real rival to the MP-5 in the terms of proliferation across the world is the famous Israeli UZI submachine gun. The MP-5, basically, is no more than the scaled-down version of the Heckler-Koch G3 battle rifle. It shares the same basic design with stamped steel receiver and the same roller-delayed Modern MP-5 submachine guns are equipped with three-lug quick detachable silencer mounts on the barrel. Sights consists of front hooded post sight and adjustable drum-type diopter rear sight. Special quick-detachable clamp mounts allows for installation of night, optical and red-dot sights if required.</text>

\nThe UMP was developed by the Heckler & Koch company of Germany in the mid- to late- 1990-ies and first appeared on the market in 1999. The key idea behind the UMP was to ceate lightweight and powerful submachine gun, that was also cheaper than the MP-5. The UMP, being targeted primary for USA law enforcement market, first appeared in .45ACP and .40SW chamberings, and later - in 9mm. The UMP is a blowback-operated select-fire submachine gun, being fired from the closed bolt. The receiver is made from the polymer, the controls are fully ambidextrous. UMP can be fired in full-auto, in single shots, and in 2 or 3 round bursts (optional). UMP also has bolt hold-open device, which traps the bolt in the open position when the last round from magazine had been fired. UMP has side-folding buttstock and two set of picatinny rails - one on the top of the receiver, and the other - on the forend. These rails can accept wide variety of sighting and other equipment, such as red-dot sights, laser pointers, tactical grips and flashlights.The barrel has quick mount for snap-on silencer.</text>

\nThe PP-2000 is the latest development of the famous Instrument Design Bureau (KBP) from Tula, Russia. It has been first displayed to the public in 2004, although the patent for its layout has been filed since 2001 and issued in 2003. Today it is already in use with some Law Enforcement (police and state security) units of the Russian Federation. The main "niche" for the PP-2000 is as a personal defense weapon for non-infantry military personnel, as well as close combat weapon for special forces and special law enforcement teams. As such, it is a compact weapon with as few parts as possible for enhanced reliability, simplified maintenance and low cost. The PP2000 is fitted with fixed open sights, and a Picatinny-type acessory rail is provided on the top of the receiver cover. This weapon is most often encountered with various types of red-dot sights, best suitable for close combat.</text>

\nThe PB (Pistolet Besshumnyj - Silenced Pistol), also known for Soviet/Russian army as 6P9, has been developed by 1967 for Spetsnaz elements of the Soviet army, as well as for operatives of KGB. The pistol is based on significantly modified Makarov PM pistol, and features an unique integral two-part silencer. The rear part of the silencer is fixed around the barrel, which is drilled to decrease the muzzle velocity below the speed of sound. The front part of the silencer is quickly detachable, so pistol can be broken down into two parts for more convenient carry. Unlike many other integrally silenced pistols the PB can be safely fired with the front part of the silencer removed, but this will greatly increase the sound signature. Still, it is an useful emergency feature. Because the front part of the barrel is enclosed into the silencer, the slide is made very short and cannot contain the return spring. Instead, the return spring is located in the grip, under the right panel, and linked to the slide via the rocking lever. The double-action firing unit with external hammer and slide-mounted safety/decocker, as well as the magazine, are borrowed from the Makarov PM pistol with no modification. The PB has fixed sights.</text>

\nThe Makarov PM is a semi-automatic pistol designed in the late 1940s, by Nikolai Fyodorovich Makarov, and was the Soviet Union's standard military side arm from 1951-1991. The Makarov pistol resulted from a design competition for replacing the Tokarev TT-33 semi-automatic pistol. Rather than building a pistol to an existing cartridge, Nikolai Makarov designed a new cartridge, the 9x18mm Makarov. For simplicity and economy, the Makarov pistol was of straight blowback operation, with the 9x18mm cartridge being the most powerful cartridge that its design could safely fire; although the nominal calibre was 9mm, the actual bullet was 9.3mm in diameter - shorter and wider and thus incompatible with pistols chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum cartridges. Consequently, Soviet ammunition was unusable in NATO firearms, hence, in war, NATO would be unable to use ammunition from killed or captured Soviet soldiers or from Soviet ammunition dumps. In 1951, the Pistol Makarova (PM) was selected because of its simplicity (few moving parts), economy, easy manufacturing, accuracy, and reasonable killing power. It remained in service with Soviet military and police until the end of the U.S.S.R. in 1991. Today, the Makarov is a popular handgun for concealed carry in the U.S.; variants of the Makarov remain in production in Russia and Bulgaria.</text>

\nThe most widely known variant, the Makarov PMM, was a redesign of the original gun. In 1990, a group of engineers reworked the original Makarov, primarily by increasing the load for the cartridge. The result is a significant increase in muzzle velocity and generation of 25% more gas pressure. The PMM magazine holds 12 rounds, compared to the PM's 8 rounds.</text>

First production models of his shotgun, named "Striker", were made during the mid-1980s, and found its way from the South Africa and into the USA, and other countries. The key advantages of the Striker shotgun were its large magazine capacity, which is doubled the traditional shotguns magazine capacity of that time, and rapid-fire capability.</text>

\nThe RG-6 (index 6G30) was in development between 1993 and 1994 by the TSKIB SOO. The new stand-alone, rapid firing multi-shot launcher was required to increase the firepower of the infantry during the urban combat, specifically for recent small-scale conflicts, such as the Chechen wars. The RG-6 entered limited production by mid-1990 and is now in use by various elements of the Russian Army and special forces, as well as by special forces in MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry). The RG-6 is designed to fire all standard 40mm "caseless" grenades, available for general issue underbarrel launchers, such as GP-25 and GP-30. These rounds include VOG-25 fragmentation grenade, VOG-25P bouncing fragmentation grenade and "Gvozd" (Nail) less-lethal tear gas grenade for riot control. The design of the RG-6 is, apparently, heavily influenced by the South African Milkor MGL grenade launcher.</text>

The PK was chambered to fire the same 7.62mm round that was and continues to be common throughout Russian supply depots and in former Soviet-supported states and clients. As a squad support weapn, the PK compliments the existing array of assault rifels that fire a middle-range version of the same round. A bipod is fitted to the underside of the barrel system for stabalized support and can be folded up and into the design when portability is required. Additionally, a carrying handle is added atop the barrel towards the middle of the weapon to make transit a snap. The weapon feeds into a feed system similar to that as found on the AK systems before it, and ca nfire from a 100, 200 or 250 round belt (either fired as a free-fed belt or held in a box). For overheating concerns, the barrel is designed to be replaceable and most necessary when sustained fire of upwards of 650 rounds per minute is reached.

\nThe RPG-7 is a further development of the previous RPG-2 antitank grenadelauncher. The RPG-7, in its first version, known as RPG-7V, has been adopted by the Soviet army in 1961, and is still widely fielded in Russia and at least 50 more countries. By far, RPG-7 can be considered as one of the most successful antitank grenade launchers ever made.Initially thought of as an anti-armor weapon, it was later adopted for other fire-support missions by the introduction of various types of grenades, such as anti-infantry HE-FRAG, multi-purpose Thermobaric / FAE, etc. The RPG-7 is a shoulder fired, single-shot, smoothbore recoilless launcher. Grenades are loaded from the front, and the rear of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle. Because of the recoilless design, there is a dangerous backblast zone, more than 20 meters/60ft long. The RPG-7 is usually issued with 2.7X fixed magnification optical sight, designated PGO-7. The RPG-7 is a simple and inexpensive weapon, yet it possess a high threat to most modern tanks, and can also serve in a number of other roles, making it a true one-man artillery.

An instant and continuous success, the P220 was adopted by the Swiss and Japanese armies, and by a large number of European police organizations. This pistol also rapidly found its way into the USA, first thorough the Browning Arms Company of Utah, and, since the mid-1980s, through the SIGARMS Company of New Hampshire.</text>

The SPAS-12 can be used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction the SPAS-12 became a very popular police and specialforces weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower. On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar shotguns and quite complicated, which results in relatively high prices.</text>

\nThe SR 25 rifle (Stoner Rifle, model 25) was developed by Reed Knight (owner of Knights Armament Co) and Eugene Stoner (designer of the M16 and Stoner 63 rifles among other things) during the early 1990s. In essence, the SR 25 was the AR-15 rifle scaled up to shoot 7.62x51/.308 Win ammunition, with up to 60% of parts of new rifle being interchangeable with standard AR-15 components. This rifle sold well among civilian shooters who needed an accurate semi-automatic rifle in 7.62/.308 caliber for hunting or target shooting. This rifle also found a favor among US Military. All rifles built on the SR-25 platform share the same basic action, which is based on AR-15/M16 system. Because of AR-15-style recoil buffer, which extends rearwards fro the receiver, SR-15 cannot be fitted with folding buttstock; most rifles are fitted with fixed butt, while SR-25 carbines are fitted with telescoping buttstock. Trigger is also of match grade, fully adjustable.</text>

\nThe SVD "Dragunov sniper rifle", is a 7.62 mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, developed in the former Soviet Union. It was selected as the winner of a contest that included three competing designs: the first was a rifle designed by Sergei Simonov (known as the SSV-58), the second – by Alexander Konstantinov (prototype designated 2B-W10) and the third rifle, the SVD-137 was a design by Evgeny Dragunov. Extensive testing of the rifles in variable environmental conditions resulted in E. F. Dragunov’s design being accepted into service in 1963. At the same time an initial pre-production batch of 200 rifles was assembled, and from 1964 serial production was carried out at Izhmash. Since then, the SVD has become the standard squad support weapon of several countries, including those of the former Warsaw Pact, among them Poland (since 1966). Licensed production of the rifle was established in China (Type 79 and Type 85) and Iraq (as the Al Kadesiah).</text>

\nThe SVU project (Snaiperskaya Vintovka Ukorochennaya- shortened sniper rifle) traces its roots back to the 1970-ies, when it was decided to develop a compact sniper rifle for Soviet airborne (VDV) troops. Such a rifle was designed using the standard Dragunov SVD action converted to a bullpup layout. Back then this project never went past its development stage, but in around 1991 it was resurrected in Tulaand and offered to the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry (MVD) as a possible weapon for urban operations.</text>

\nOriginally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. </text>

\nThe SR-3 "Vikhr" ("Whirlwind") compact assault rifle was developed in TSNIITOCHMASH by A. Borisov and V. Levchenko during the early 1990-ies. Initially known as "MA" (Malogabaritnyj Avtomat = small-size assault rifle), it was based on the silenced 9 mm AS "Val" assault rifle, and intended for concealed carry by special VIP protection teams and State security operatives. The SR-3 is widely used by various FSO (Federal Protection Service, a VIP protection organization, which guard the President and other government officials of the Russian Federation) and FSB (Federal Security Service) operatives, elite Russian counter-terror teams. Following the demand from users, the TSNIITOCHMASH recently developed an improved version of the SR-3, with intent to produce a more versatile weapon for Law Enforcement use. The new SR-3M (Modified) compact assault rifle features more convenient fire controls and charging handle, integral forward grip (folding), and, most important, specially developed quick-detachable silencer (sound moderator) and a standard side rail for mounting day or night optics on the left side of the receiver. Another useful accessory for the SR-3M is a new magazine with enlarged capacity (30 rounds), which also provides more reliable feeding during automatic fire. Open sights consist of a protected front post nd a flip-up rear sight with U-notch, with settings for 100 and 200 meters range.</text>

\nDesigned at TSNIITochMash by Peter Serdyukov and his team, the new rifle was intended to replace some AK-47/AKM rifles, fitted with silencers, in the hands of various Special Operations (SpetsNaz) troops of the Soviet Army, KGB and MVD.The VSS is quite popular among its users for its stealthy capabilities and the great lethality of the heavy 9mm bullets. The effective range of the VSS is limited to 300-400 meters. The VSS is a gas operated, selective fire weapon. The silencer is the integral part of the weapon, and while it could be easily removed for storage or maintenance, the VSS shound not be fired with its silencer removed due to safety and reliability issues. Standard sighting equipment consists of side rail on the receiver, which usually accommodates the 4X PSO-1M2-01 scope. Any other scope or night vision sight can be mounted on the appropriate mount. Backup iron sights consist of tangent rear and blade front. The Rear sight is graduated for up to 400 meters. Feeding is achieved from a 10 or 20 round box magazines made from polymer.</text>

\nThe P99 pistol was a rather radical step forward for the Walther company, made under new management. The development of a new pistol started in 1994 and the first production pistols were shown to public in 1997. The earliest pistols were made in 9mm, and a .40 S&W version appeared in 1999. By 2004, the Carl Walther company presented the second generation of the P99 pistols. These new guns had even better ergonomics, and new model designations. As the duty pistol for law enforcement agencies in North America, Europe and Asia, the P99 has endured some of the harshest operating conditions a handgun will ever see. The P99 is truly a world class handgun for professionals who must trust their lives to a firearm.</text>

\nThe Winchester 1300 shotgun was first introduced in around 1981, when the US Repeating Arms Company (USRAC) took over production of the 'Winchester' brand guns from the Olin/Winchester corporation. In fact, the model 1300 was a slightly modified version of the previous Winchester model 1200 shotgun, which was manufactured by Olin/Winchester between 1964 and 1980. The Winchester1300 shotguns are also known as the 'Speed pump', because of the very fast-cycling pump action, which makes these guns popular among both hunters and sport shooters. These shotguns also work well for home defense and security applications, especially with availability of relatively short-barreled models with long magazines.</text>
