My boys are putting fire down on them from time to time, just to make sure they don't escape. Come and join us, we're about to finish 'em off. If you help us, I'll give you the scientist's suit - we found it in the chopper we took down. Your target is Professor Kruglov. Shoot him, or he'll run away during the shootout - I know his type.

Don't forget that the prototype can't protect you from the emissions forever, so you need to get to the bunker under the antennae, and shut down the Scorcher quickly. Then get to the antennae and switch them off, too...</text>

		<text>I looked through the documents I found at the Agroprom Institute. It appears that the Institute was used as a front for an unofficial lab called X-18, which hosted a number of highly unusual experiments. Its location isn't clear from the documents, and the Military don't seem to know much about it either. Maybe this is the starting point the traders need. Now I need to travel further North to a certain trader known as the Barkeep</text>
	</string>
	<string id="journal_bar_darklab_documents">
		<text>Lab X-18 wasn't fun, and neither were its current residents. I didn't think things like that existed...\nI found some documents. I didn't understand much of what was written in them, except that they contained technical specs for some parts of the Kaymanov emitters.\nWhat's interesting is that those parts were destined for another lab with the codename X-16. Chances are it's a secret one, too</text>
	</string>
	<string id="journal_bar_x16_documents">
		<text>The traders have dug up a lot of information about these labs. The Barkeep wasn't surprised to learn of the emitters and X-16. Now he's convinced that the Brain Scorcher is man-made. He thinks that Lab X-16 is close to the scientists' camp by Lake Yantar.\nIt's interesting that they're studying emissions that resemble the effects of the Scorcher. So now I must pay a visit to the Zone's esteemed scientific community...</text>

	<string id="journal_before_darklab_documents">
		<text>I met with Barkeep. Having looked through the documents from the Institute, he thinks that this X-18 lab is in the Dark Valley, and asked me to go there to look for information and documents.\nHe says he sent Duty scouts to get into the underground vaults there, but none came back. Barkeep thinks they were captured by the Bandits who have a base nearby. If that's true, everything those Duty guys found will be in the hands of Borov, the leader.\nBarkeep told me to be careful and... well, clearly he didn't tell me everything about these underground vaults.\nTime to get to work. I need to pay Borov a visit, and if our 'encounter' goes well, I'll find a way into the underground...</text>

		<text>I'm finally ready to visit the Scorcher. I found out from Crazy the times when the emission levels decrease. Also a safe place where I can wait for these periods to occur. My Psi-protection won't work at other times anyway. I'll need to find a way into the underground bunker of X-10. That's where the controls for the Brain Scorcher antennae should be</text>
