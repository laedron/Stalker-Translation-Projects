		<text>My dear Owl. Please forgive me, but if you're reading this I'm probably dead. There is no shame in death, my friend. I want to tell you everything, and this will be the final payment of my debts\nThat fight at the Army Warehouses is not what you think. We were waiting for you, but a hit squad was waiting for us! Whomever Ghost crossed, the equipment and weapons used against us must have come from someone who really wanted him dead... The Ecologists had just returned, two of them wounded, and they'd set up a temporary camp. I was waiting, about fifty metres from them, when they called to me for help. Near the Red Forest! But it was my job, and I couldn't refuse...\nJust as I stood up, someone took a shot at Ghost from God knows where and, at the exact same moment, a Controller appeared behind us! Maybe the shot confused it, because as Ghost went down, it ignored me and went straight for for the Ecologists! The Controller hurled them all into their campfire, while a pack of blind dogs started to attack me!\nThere was an old woman dressed in red in the distance, well away from the dogs, and she was waving to me! It was so surreal, but her waving arm was like a warning flag to me, and pulled me from my panic. I ended up with injuries to my hands, arms and legs, though I managed to drive us to Pripyat. Ghost looked in pretty bad condition, so we stopped and started a camp fire. I'd just laid Ghost down to rest by the fire, when the 'white haze' came out of nowhere... that Controller had followed us! Fang and I ran in opposite directions and it went after him, so I doubled back and emptied the rest of my mag into it. But by the time I returned to Ghost, the remaining part of his mind had been taken, and our friend lay there lifeless...\nThat night, after 'the white haze', something new was born within me. Something very, very different. After a while the Doctor arrived and dragged me away. He sensed that my body wasn't all that was wounded...\nWe'd given everything for nothing! I'd risked my life for the Zone... for the sake of what? I realized then that every contract has a deeper contract hidden behind it...\nFor all the time that I rested at the Doctor's place, he never once spoke to me. Sometimes he went away, never telling me where. I'd pretend to be asleep, but in reality there was no energy left behind my eyes...\n
		A few days later I was able to sit up, and the Doctor asked me just one thing. Why did the Zone present itself to me? Why me, and for what? What did it need me to do? What does it want resolved? I couldn't give him answers, because the answers had left me. He told me he had to leave, but that we would meet again\nAlone, I searched for death within myself, knowing it was there and waiting for it to show itself... When it did not I willed myself to the Arena instead, taking on allcomers, hoping that someone, or something, would do what the Zone could not - turn me to offal, fit only for pigs. But it wasn't to be, and every match made me stronger and sharper. I hung around Rostok for several weeks. Everyone knew that Ghost had gone missing, but not one approached me... I spent some time training rookies, teaching them the ways of the Zone (Ha! one of my favourite students, Palyonyj, said I must have mutated extra eyes in the back of my head!) but each time I potentially saved a life I knew that, while I was still in debt, the Zone would never release me...\nLater I met Mole, but he left for the Cordon. I remained alone, and began to search for the one who'd ordered the hit on Ghost. I talked discretely to many people, followed leads, went undercover to seek out contracts and remuneration, and tried to figure out the payment I should make in return. I have yet to find it! Worse still, since that day in Pripyat, the old fear has returned, and I no longer know how to face it...\nSoon I will go to check out something. I have received an offer from Arhara... Maybe I will go to meet him...\nI'm sorry, my friend. It is so difficult, but so necessary, to tell you all this...\nYour friend through everything, Strelok</text>

	<string id="voen_about_group_text">
		<text>I am the only one left from our group. The mission is a failure... This document is the only thing that keeps my identity alive... My memory fails me constantly, and I need to keep writing down my thoughts and re-reading them. This is the only way that works, and I hope it will keep my mind right until I get there, and tell everyone everything I know - this is the most important thing now...\nIt was a standard escort mission, protecting scientists working north of the Army Warehouses within variable intensity Psi-fields. They were testing a combined hardware-chemical device to protect against a new type of Psi-emitter. Everyone was in a good mood. Even Nauchniki was singing as he walked. I noticed a patrol on the left. What they were doing there I had no idea. There were two of them, obviously military, although the loony with the machine gun looked more dangerous to his buddy. Any idiot can fire a gun - the trick is to put your rounds where they need to go...\nThe spikes in Psi-activity occurred at an unusual rate, frequently stopping, and enabling the Scientists to take measurements. The pattern of the Psi-field intensity forced you to learn it by heart - at its height your helmet becomes heavy, your head twists and your neck bends sideways. Everything looks yellow, and this is when zombification starts. The cycle repeats every two hours... It was one of the scariest jobs I've ever done, knowing that if their Psi-protection failed... But they've come a long way with this experiment, and we were able to stay alert and alive... Well, until we compromised the patrol - and now there were five of them! They suddenly sprang into action... God, their sniper was good! Then a Controller arrived, coinciding with the new Psi-cycle! We hadn't noticed it with our protection on... Then the patrol started firing, and the Controller dominated them... The sniper got me in the head. My helmet was damaged, the electronics went crazy, and I got hit with a mix of concussion and Psi-activity... I saw the sniper with the Vintorez circling around the controller, before I fell to the ground... I watched everyone in our group get killed, including the scientists, then the Controller disappeared...\nI didn't regain any kind of consciousness until the evening, but I couldn't stand up until the next day. My head still pounded, I was full of nausea, but I knew I had to get myself together... I used a medkit, and put on a new bandage. I started to write things down as I remembered them. Then I blacked out again...\nLater on, in the Dump, I met another Stalker. I hardly remember him, since my head was still wounded... He knew I was injured, and gave me a backpack with a bandage, a medkit, half a bottle of vodka and some food. On his insistence, I agreed to find a bed and rest. I will leave my PDA on a post. It will contain a route, and a copy of my diary. I'm afraid. Please do not look for me. I just want to find the Samaritan, and thank him... Ghost</text>

Usually we avoid Stalkers, and this one didn't appear to have anything of value. He wasn't even armed, for fuck's sake! But he was stumbling a bit and didn't look well. Is he playing us, I thought? No, he was obviously injured. At first I went over to join the others, but then this guy noticed my buddy and waved. We went over to him, and he offered us some bread and a few other things. He didn't seem to want to keep anything - he even gave us his PDA! Well, we thought it was our lucky day... until later on when we found Razderbanili, one of ours. Someone had strung him to a tree by his neck and cut his throat. What was scary was that he still all had his stuff on him, including his PDA... It said he was looking for that bastard, Borov.
