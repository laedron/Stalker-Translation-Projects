	</string>
	<string id="fox_bring_1">
		<text>These damn dogs have torn my trousers to pieces. They chase me like I've got a backpack full of sausage. Listen, Marked One, can you bring me a parcel from the Duty outpost on the North side of the garbage? Just ask the commander, he's expecting me. It's a good gun that will help keep these dogs from tearing me to pieces. And while your helping me out I will stay with the Doctor. And don't worry, the award will be adequate...</text>

	<string id="fox_bring_2">
		<text>No problem Fox, I will help you out. I need to recon that area anyway, be back soon</text>

	</string>
	<string id="fox_give_0">
		<text>Here Fox, I have brought your gun... A Good weapon, I really like it. Prapor did not want to give it to me. It was necessary to take a great risk getting bloodsucker tentacles. And you of course know how they fight, I need some Vodka!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fox_give_1">
		<text>Well thanks, Marked One! Sorry for all the trouble. Now that I've got some good fire power those mutants are going to pay!... Here's you reward</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prapor_bring_jaw_0">
		<text>Greetings, Prapor, I come on business. Fox said that your holding a parcel for him. He got injured by some Psuedodogs so I've come to pick it up</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prapor_bring_jaw_1">
		<text>Well what do you think this is, a post office? If you want it, your going to have to earn it! Bring me a pair of Bloodsucker tentacles, then you can have the parcel. For storage fees, so to speak</text>	<!-- Changed 'two feelers' to 'a pair of tentacles' - Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16-->

		<text>Well looks like you mean business... all right I will bring them, if I survive. I don't think Fox will live much longer without a better weapon and I made a promise</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prapor_give_jaw_0">
		<text>So, Prapor, about my health... don't ask. Here are your tentacles. It was hard to get them. Where's the parcel?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prapor_give_jaw_1">
		<text>Thank you, Marked One! Well you're not a rookie after all. These tentacles are necessary for my health, strong medicine can be made from them. Yes my troubles have ended. To be honest we had a wager on whether you would return or not. I lost 5 bottles of Vodka in that bet... HA!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_0">
		<text>Looks like I need your help</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_1">
		<text>All eventually need my help. All the Zone uses my information</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_2">
		<text>General Voronin has sent me ... tell me what you know about who killed Fang, and why did they do it!?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_3">
		<text>Marked One, you're a person respected in the Zone. But why do people think that they can approach me free of charge and demand that I share my information? No way bub, you want info you pay! In general though, I have lately been told that someone has stolen the PDA of Tirana, the leader of the Mercenaries. In general he now, to put it mildly, is strongly upset, much like a flight of furious baboons. I hope you understand how valuable the information is and how much it costs. Many are hunting for this PDA, both Duty, and Freedom, and Bandit wasps, are all trying to find it before the others. And so, I know who has it and where this person is. If you agree to bring it to me I will point you towards the person, he will tell you everything that he knows. And I believe he knows much</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_4">
		<text>Okay, we will do it your way. Where is this 'miracle person' with the PDA?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_5">
		<text>On the Marshes there is a new shopkeeper. My sources say that he is somehow connected with this business and most likely has the PDA</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_tiran_6">
		<text>I will find him, that's all I need to know</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_bring_0">
		<text>I'm back in one piece and here's the PDA. Listen, Mercenaries seem to know too much about where and when I will be somewhere, I just foiled another ambush. Did you try to set me up?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_bring_1">
		<text>This is excellent, well done! You're a Man of his word! Mercenaries you say? Every faction is hunting for this PDA. At one time or another the Military, Freedom, Duty, and even those egg head scientists at Yantar have used their services to get their dirty work done without tarnishing their image. Listen to me attentively, I've got the information you need. In the Army Warehouses, on the base of Freedom in one of the barracks, you will find LeHavre. He is the one who will answer your questions about Fang</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_bring_2">
		<text>Are you serious? On the base of Freedom a Mercenary! Has the world gone mad? Or am I missing something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_bring_3">
		<text>Not so loud, do not shout. You do not know this terrible person, he has connections with many powerful and evil people. Freedom receives prototypes of new weapons through his suppliers. So they turn a blind eye and let him do business on their base. LeHavre is a very serious and dangerous man, always be on your guard. Good luck to you. By the way, take this Artefact it's quite good</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_give_0">
		<text>Dan! your going to give me that PDA and the only price I will pay is in lead! I know you have it, don't try to play games!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_give_1">
		<text>Marked One, calm down! Here take it, I was holding it as storage for somebody. I don't even know what's on it!...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_give_2">
		<text>That little ass-hole who gave me that PDA almost got me killed, when I see him he will catch a bullet!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_give_3">
		<text>Believe me Dan, I didn't want you to kill, but this is very serious business</text>
	</string>
	<string id="informator_pda_give_4">
		<text>It's okay Marked One, good luck to you...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_take_first_0">
		<text>Are you LeHavre? the informant has sent me</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_take_first_1">
		<text>The Marked One has come! The informant has told me that you search for the murderer of Fang. I can help but it's necessary for you to do some jobs for us, which I will pay you for. Then I will tell you what you want to know</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_take_first_2">
		<text>Seems I'm making a deal with the devil, what evil deeds do you have in mind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_take_first_3">
		<text>Stalker, try to understand, if you want to learn the secrets of the dead you will do what I ask. You brought a PDA to the informant. And from the data recovered we have discovered that in our well-disposed ranks is a rat. But not so simple, it's one of our leaders. Enough direct evidence is not present, so I cannot kill him myself. That would lead to reprisals and a possible clan war. And you, as the tramp extraneous, killing this person would avoid all possible consequences. Bolt is the rat, and he is nearby at the end of the road that leads to this base. If you extract his personal PDA, I will have proof of his participation in the theft of Tirana's PDA. You agree? A good reward awaits you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_take_first_4">
		<text>Aright I will bring you the PDA, what choice do I have</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_bring_pda_0">
		<text>You jackass, you could have given me an idea of what I was walking into! Snipers and RPGs!, here take it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_bring_pda_1">
		<text>It is insulting to me, listening to your vulgar mouth. I'm a person with a vulnerable soul and a thin constitution. Anyway, you know that the Zone is full of unexpectedness and troubles. Alright, here's a five-copeck coin for vodka</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_help_one_0">
		<text>Well I can't believe it!, Gordon Freeman in person. How did you get here? I heard you had been killed, but that must have been lies</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_help_one_1">
		<text>All I remember is making my way into the Zone. In the Cordon I hired a guide from a man named Sidorovich for big money. Then he took me through a valley, past a lake, and into a factory complex. I look at my Guide and see something is wrong, I try to talk to him but he doesn't respond. His eyes are glazed and empty, I fear he is turning into a Zombie. I hear the roar of a monster and I'm scared for my life. I see a tunnel with many Anomalies. I'm more scared of mutants than anomalies so I work my way into the tunnel and find a place to sleep. My head hurt badly, but finally I fell asleep. I don't know how long I was there, a week? a month? I can't remember. I was woken up by a roar, more terrible than I ever heard before. I saw a huge mutant with two heads!. It stood in the middle of an Electro anomaly and was charging in it. I tried to get out silently. But it heard me and began to growl terribly. Without bolts, without a detector, I got up and ran and didn't stop till I found refuge here. I left all my gear in that tunnel, my Desert Eagle altered to fire the more common 9x39 cartridge. The gun is strong, I personally could kill a pair of bloodsuckers in one clip. Truth is, I'm afraid to go back there. Will you find me this gun? Bring my weapons to me and I will give you one of them. And an Artefact recipe</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_help_one_2">
		<text>Freeman, pull yourself together, I will find your gun</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_bring_one_0">
		<text>Gordon, I'm back! Here's your gun</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_bring_one_1">
		<text>Marked One I am glad to call you my friend. Here take the Desert Eagle as promised</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_help_0">
		<text>Enjoying the Barman's company? Too much Vodka is a good thing sometimes</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_help_1">
		<text>Yes, he is good company and can drink like a fish. Marked One I've got more serious business I need your help with. When travelling with my Guide and reaching the Wild Territory, I met a person. His name is DeJames, he claimed to be from America also. Having drunk lots of Vodka, he persuaded me to give him my document case for safe keeping. And in it is very important documents. I need that case but I'm afraid to go back there. He stays in a small carriage in the Wild Territory. Will you go and pick it up for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_help_2">
		<text>Well alright. What was his name, DeJames? In the Zone I don't trust outsiders</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_james_speak_0">
		<text>I've come to get Freeman's Case...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_james_speak_1">
		<text>It's mine now tramp, piss off before I give you a slap</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_james_speak_2">
		<text>I will teach you some manners with my fist</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_james_speak_3">
		<text>Get ready to eat a bullet, it will precisely shut you up</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_bring_0">
		<text>Freeman you will come to a bad end. You sent me into a Hornet's nest. My weapon has overheated from meeting with your goat of a friend. You had better explain!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_bring_1">
		<text>Marked One, what has happened? I don't understand</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_bring_2">
		<text>Your DeJames, the mongrel! and four of his gang attacked me! They now chew lead in hell! Here's your case</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_case_bring_3">
		<text>Sorry Marked One, I never knew something like that would happen. Here take this, I hope it compensates you for the repair of your gear</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_doc_radar_0">
		<text>Well LeHavre, what's next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_doc_radar_1">
		<text>Marked One, onto the next order of business. One of the Monolithians was supposed to extract documents and deliver them to us. However communication with him has broken down, he doesn't answer his PDA. The last message we received from him came from the Radar. During an emission we think he took cover in Lab X-10. Your problem - to find him and to take the documents. We know that you have received a helmet which protects you from psi-radiation from the scientists</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_doc_radar_2">
		<text>I Doubt an emission has the same effect on a Monolithian. Alright LeHavre, I will look for the guy</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_doc_radar_bring_0">
		<text>I found your Monolithian. Only he is dead, and not just the Monolithian, also a lab full of mutants. Here take your documents</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_doc_radar_bring_1">
		<text>So, the Marked One performs under pressure. A real professional! Well here, take a well-deserved reward</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_talk_0">
		<text>Freeman, we need to talk</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_talk_1">
		<text>Marked One, what about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_talk_2">
		<text>As soon as I started this investigation into the death of my friend, Fang, at once Mercenaries began to appear. At first LeHavre, then Bolt, then Foreign Mercenaries have tried to kill me. I have extracted the document from LeHavre, also made a copy. Anything you can understand from it? I in general suspect that it was not sent to you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_talk_3">
		<text>Marked One, I am on the task. So... Interesting... All! I, apparently, have understood, who and what for Fang was killed. But I do not have enough information. Listen, Marked One, such business, in papers that you have brought in my case, there were for some documents of DeJames. And so in them it is told about a super confidential meeting of leaders of the Mercenaries. The meeting as I have understood, should occur somewhere in the Dark Valley. And so, at this meeting there will be a certain Bland. He should have an important flash card, you need to descend there and to take away this flash card. Also hurry, Marked One, soon other leaders will arrive and there will be no place there to spit at for protection</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_talk_4">
		<text>I will find this Bland and get the Card... I have great hopes that this will finally solve my friends murder!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_bring_0">
		<text>Here is the Flash Card of Bland, take it</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_bring_1">
		<text>Give it here and I will examine it. Well here... as I thought. In general, Marked One, business such. One of the gangs of Mercenaries which basically consists of foreigners, has decided to grasp the Monolith. For what I do not know, but hardly for something good. Fang was employed to work alone. Simply it was one of those not many who made campaigns in the Zone center. Such person was necessary to Mercenaries and consequently they have suggested it to work on them, having told that orders arrive from various scientific research institutes. And you know that Fang was clever with electronics and helped the scientists in Yantar. But in due course Fang has scented wrong and has started to dig. They have discovered it and have ordered the hit. Who do you think gave the order?... LeHavre! He must be the main co-ordinator of this organization in the Zone. Without these documents nobody solves anything. By the way here to you a gift from me</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_bring_2">
		<text>Thanks, Freeman, I suspected that LeHavre of a bough, but now I am assured of it. All right. I will go, good riddance to that bum!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bland_flash_bring_3">
		<text>Good luck, Marked One. Be more careful</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_braad_one_0">
		<text>How's life treating you these days... Freeman?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_braad_one_1">
		<text>Same as usual... here now, there later... you know how it is</text>
	</string>
	<string id="freeman_braad_one_2">
		<text>Life can be a little warped now and then, can't it... well... hope you're around for awhile, eh!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_final_dialog_0">
		<text>Well, the Chap, has learnt me? You know, what for I have come?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_final_dialog_1">
		<text>Slow down man... let us have a drink... I have some nice Cognac here... Our base in the Dark Valley recently - was that your work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_final_dialog_2">
		<text>Yes I have no place to hurry up especially, give. Yes base - my work. And your six of Bland I too enjoy. But now I have exact proof of your fault. For who has killed my friend Fang?</text>
	</string>
	<!-- 109984, dialog improvement done to here -->
	<string id="gavr_final_dialog_3">
		<text>It worked any time for us in dark, thinking that works on scientists. We to it well paid, to begin with even gave it tasks on more harmless, type bring an artefact, remove gauging. Though an overall objective always was - the Monolith. We searched for possible ways of pass to the Monolith, and you, that is Streloks, and Fang - one of the few who there happened and knew as there to get. But, probably, he began to suspect us, has started to dig, and has then tried to disappear. We were afraid that it, can merge the information on us to somebody and consequently I have personally made the decision on Fang liquidation. The sniper waited for it in village of bloodsuckers. Further you know</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gavr_final_dialog_4">

		<text>It only soporific, do not worry you while to me live it is necessary, well has had a rest? Yes spit you on Fang, about itself see to it better</text>

	<string id="gavr_finalend_dialog_2">
		<text>Spit you speak? Here so to take and forget that was? Say 'Fang, you certainly the guy good, we with you have together worried so much, but now I and about myself should see to it'. So you offer? And so know - Strelok does not betray</text>

		<text>Dan, what will you take in trade?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_trade_buck_1">
		<text>Nobody in the Zone trades mutant parts on the level I do. These hands, feet, tails, eyes and are necessary to nobody for nothing, neither Sidorovich, nor to local stalkers! The nearest place where you can get something for them is in the Garbage, to the stalker by name of Raven, and that's just tails. But if your just looking for cash the scientist in the bunker, on lake Yantar, researches parts of bodies of mutants from all corners of the Zone. He pays a decent price, we do a lot of business with him. Still I would advise to check with Raven and see what he has to offer...Now, Marked One, here's what I offer: For 3 big eyes of fleshes - I will give 3 packs of armour-piercing cartridges 9x19. For 5 heads of Tushkanos - 3 packs of armour-piercing cartridges 11.43x23. If you bring 2 hands of the Controller - you will receive 5 packs of armour-piercing 5.45 mm</text>

	<string id="dan_grab_helmet_3">
		<text>Marked One, you're not being fair! This information is reliable and a group of fighters are waiting to join you for the assault. When you arrive on the Agroprom, you will meet with Arhara and his men. A solid group of veterans, with lots of experience in the Zone. Arhara was once a member of 'Freedom', but then had some disagreements with Lukash. He left and took his men to form a group of 'independents'</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_grab_helmet_4">
		<text>Alright Dan I will go and meet Arhara. I will judge what kind of a man he is for myself</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_agro_helmet_0">
		<text>Are you Arhara?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_agro_helmet_1">
		<text>Yes, and you must be Marked One? Greetings, we have been waiting for you. Let me tell you our plan, we go through the southern gate and put down resistance in the compound. While you will be engaged in the main complex and will take away from the scientists a parcel. There Ivaschenko, the head scientist, will be with the parcel likely on his person</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_agro_helmet_2">
		<text>The plan sounds good, lets go. Its nice to meet some fighters willing to share the risk</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_bring_helmet_0">
		<text>Dan, it was there. Here I brought this helmet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_bring_helmet_1">
		<text>This is interesting, your a fine fellow Marked One. Here's your reward. I will examine this for awhile and we will speak later. Yes, Arhara asked if you would come and see him about some business</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_0">
		<text>Hello Arhara, Dan said you wanted to talk to me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_1">
		<text>One of my men went into the Agroprom underground two days ago and has not returned. You know from experience that the place is full of evil spirits, bandits, mutants, and even soldiers. He had a notebook of mine that I wouldn't want to fall into the wrong hands. Will you find him and bring back the notebook?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_2">
		<text>Why don't you send one of your own fighters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_3">
		<text>There are only a few of us left now, so I can't take the risk. Bandits and mutants grow in numbers, every man with a weapon is important. You, as I saw for myself, are a master. You know the catacombs better than any stalker. The men have donated cartridges to give to you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_4">
		<text>I will find your notebook, cartridges I always need</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_bring_0">
		<text>How's the situation now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_bring_1">
		<text>My fighters are under too much pressure holding this complex. I'm afraid its necessary to leave here. Do you have the notebook?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_bring_2">
		<text>Yes, here you are. Your man is dead, I believe he ran into an Electro anomaly while trying to escape the Controllers</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_help_bring_3">
		<text>Thanks Marked One, we are lucky to have you as a friend. Controllers you say? then it really is necessary to change location</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_need_do_0">
		<text>Arhara, is there anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_need_do_1">
		<text>Marked One, there is another task on the Radar. In the red wood, near a helicopter, lies a backpack and nearby a foot locker. Take away anything you find there as an award. The most important thing at the crash site is my laptop, it contains important data! I need you to find it and bring to my brother Yakut</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_need_do_2">
		<text>Arhara, the PSI-radiation will kill me before I even get close to the crash site. Also, where would I find your brother Yakut?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_need_do_3">
		<text>Marked One, remember the helmet you took to Dan? It will help you, with it you can pass through psi-radiation</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_need_do_4">
		<text>Alright, I will go speak to Dan, but I have my doubts about this helmet...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_need_do_5">
		<text>don't worry brother, I speak the truth. You will find Yakut in the Army Warehouses. He is camped with a group of stalkers, their leader is called Wolf</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_done_notebook_0">
		<text>Are you Yakut? I have brought you the laptop</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_done_notebook_1">
		<text>Marked One!!! Long live your mother! My brother will be happy you found the laptop and that you returned safely. Arhara praised you, says your a professional</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_done_notebook_2">
		<text>I'm glad its over, too many Anomalies and doggies...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_nauch_flash_0">
		<text>Dan, have you learned anything about the helmet?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_nauch_flash_1">
		<text>Yes, its almost adjusted, but I'm missing some information. Listen, have you gathered info from laboratory X-18? There's some data in this laboratory about the influence of psi-waves on the human brain. For certain they have more detailed information on this phenomenon. Bring to me the information from there or a flash card with the data. With this info I could adjust it quickly</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_nauch_flash_2">
		<text>I will go to the lab and look for the flash card for you. I can't go to the Radar without a working helmet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_nauch_flash_bring_0">
		<text>Greetings Dan, here's the flash card</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dan_nauch_flash_bring_1">
		<text>Well, let me take a look. Aha... So... that's what's necessary. Marked One, Wait while I adjust the helmet and I will give it to you... The helmet is adjusted and should protect you from psi-radiation. Here you are, good luck Marked One</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_0">
		<text>What's on your mind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_1">
		<text>Listen, Marked One, about that corpse you found in the lab. Could you tell if it was really the body of Ghost? I have doubts that Ghost was lost. I don't think a professional like Ghost would have fallen to a controller. I will tell you something that very few people know, Ghost didn't come here alone. The stalker that was with him was almost a look-alike. We continually confused them. You after all hardly remember what Ghost looked like. Do you think its really his corpse in the lab!?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_2">
		<text>It could be someone else, what else leads you to suspect its not him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_3">
		<text>Before Vasilyev, and Ghost went into the Laboratory, we shared a small bottle the prior evening. We talked about the Zone, about the Monolith, but Ghost was mostly silent that evening. He had a look in his eyes, like a predator. He did say that all surviving members of Strelok's Group were being hunted down ... He said he came to Yantar for the solitude, as there remains but only a few people here. Too many Zombies, and Snorks to look out for. I asked Ghost if they were brothers, he told me that they had got acquainted recently at the Bar. You know what I think?, he wanted to make it look like he was dead. And there lies the other loner, not Ghost. Now everyone thinks that he is dead, and that makes it easier for him to hide</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_4">
		<text>Well, you could be right. Do you have any idea where he might hide?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_5">
		<text>Listen, Marked One, I have co-ordinates of a cache in Agroprom. I will send the location to your PDA. Ghost gave me these co-ordinates in case he didn't make it back. Marked One, go there and see if you can find some information on where he might be hiding</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_about_prizrak_6">
		<text>Agroprom? I will go and see if I can find something</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_first_prizrak_0">
		<text>Greetings, I have found it, there the diary was. Lying on the ground and its in poor condition so to read written text is difficult enough. The only thing, here, in one place about a person is written... 'You will find it in the Warehouses, near the base of Freedom'</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_first_prizrak_1">
		<text>Give it to me, the truth may lie within. Listen, Marked One, you should go to the Bar in Rostok and ask around, I will look over the diary, if I can read any more of it</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_first_prizrak_2">
		<text>It is fine, and most in the Bar it is necessary to me, to Barman business is, besides to buy something it would be advisable. I hope you can understand that</text>

	<string id="barm_about_prizrak_3">
		<text>Such business, Marked One, somewhere with one month ago or more, he was in the Bar and came to me, in general conversation concerns only me and Ghost, but... In general, he asked to find a 'master key', so to say with certain appearance</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barm_about_prizrak_4">
		<text>Barman, do not muddle, I know about the 'master key'... similar to Ghost! Further...</text>

	<string id="barm_about_prizrak_5">
		<text>Marked One, you understand, I am a businessman, and the information, like as, too the goods. Give so, bring to me one artefact of Simbion and I will tell you everything that I know</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barm_about_prizrak_6">
		<text>You are more of a 'Pusher' than a Businessman ... Fine!! I will go, and have a look...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barm_simb_prizrak_0">
		<text>Well 'businessman', I have brought you a Simbion</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barm_simb_prizrak_1">
		<text>Marked One, you, as always, please! It is pleasant to deal with you! In general listen, yes, he asked me to find the person more or less similar to it. A problem the extremely difficult, appearance at Ghost picturesque so I and itself did not hope that I can find, but day through two after ours with it of conversation, Dolg have caught the music, is not far from the Southern outpost, it somehow painfully suspiciously conducted itself(himself), as subsequently it has appeared, he did not eat three days it, spoke that the Bloodsucker has attacked it also it, escaping, all things has lost also a miracle he has reached the Bar. I in general, all the same, am said lies by it or not. The main thing that it as two drops is similar on Ghost. Well I have fed him, have given out which what need. Ghost Here has come, they about something have talked and have fallen down towards Yantar. Everything, is more I that, another did not see. And then I was reached by the information that Ghost has left in a lab and... Has not returned. Yes he asked, that I spoke to nobody, about a 'master key' so I hope, it remains between us. Yes has absolutely forgotten. Scientists asked you to come to Yantar, they have business for you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barm_simb_prizrak_2">

	<string id="uceh_second_prizrak_0">
		<text>Well, could read something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="uceh_second_prizrak_1">
		<text>Marked One, such business, in General I try to restore make-shifts of a diary but if it is fair, results yet not impressing. Listen, you could not help us? We have departed to last emission protection. We have somehow repaired it, but it all the same works through time. We have ordered to ourselves new. But the helicopter is not present some days, on visible because of last emissions, to us on Yantar it is very difficult to reach by air. And we without the computer as without hands. And I would decipher Ghost diary faster</text>

	</string>
	<string id="uceh_second_prizrak_3">

	</string>
	<string id="yakut_first_prizrak_3">
		<text>There is one place. Can you descend, you will look? Catacombs under Agroprom you know? And so, I assume that if it is live, could hide there somewhere</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_first_prizrak_4">
		<text>An Agroprom Vault you tell? Well all right I descend though if fairly not to be trusted who will want to hide in a monastery of bloodsuckers? Unless only the madman or insane and unbelievable. As I understand Ghost not that, another</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_second_prizrak_0">
		<text>Well the Yakut, is not present there Ghost, but I was met by the pleasant company from bandits, bloodsuckers, well and still there were there persons any strange, truth they met me unfortunately not with colors. More shortly the Yakut an ambush there</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yakut_second_prizrak_1">
		<text>Yes, it is visible not one you you do not trust in death of Ghost. All right, I know one more place on the Radar. You know where an entrance in laboratory X-10? And so where there it should be. If and there it is not present, then I at all do not know than to you to help</text>

	</string>
	<string id="talk_prizrak_2">
		<text>Questions has collected much, well here it is not so quiet, so tell though in brief how you managed to get out of laboratory? Yes me here met very 'amicably', and on Agroprom obviously someone waited. To whom have you salted?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_prizrak_3">
		<text>You know the narrator of me, but oh well. In general, the three of us went to the Lab: I, Vasiliev, well, 'Jimmy'. I myself did not know exactly get us off burner or not. Yes, and I went there to trick my persecutors. You probably already know about my 'master key'? There is a sin on his soul, still feel sorry for the guy, but act otherwise I could not. He did not believe that you're dead. There was no place in the Zone where I felt safe. But after the stunt with the corpse, I finally was able to do the quest. Through some of his people, I learned that you are alive. You probably know, there is a grouping of Avengers? Well, not what they do not Avengers, ordinary Mercenaries. Kill anyone they will order. However, there is a mystery. Rumor has it that such groups run by people from the clan of murderers Last Day. Did you know that on my youth, I slapped the former leader of ... According to unconfirmed reports - the clan got together again and now understand why they want to destroy me ... A horseradish hide from them, with no faction does not want to deal with, fear them, even Monolith try to pass them by. In general, I found out who is behind their head - Beast. If it is eliminated. it is possible at the time I was left alone. My boys recently told me that the beast and his right-hand oblique settled in the swamps - where they have a farm on the outskirts, apparently want to organize there something like the base ... I have sent there kids, but without you I am afraid they will not cope. Take it? Yes, it is important not only to kill him, but stick to get him there a list of all the victims, and certainly we in him. The approximate location of our people to throw off your PDA</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_prizrak_4">
		<text>Ghost, your war my war, your enemy my enemy. So I am ready to hurt someone soon. I've seen people from the clan of the Last Day, so it seems, is not a fairy tale</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_prizrak_zver_0">
		<text>Greetings, Ghost, in general was possible for Beast to escape, here, by the way, a flash card, apparently, here the list of all of whom already... Or only gather.

	</string>
	<string id="talk_prizrak_zverfinal_1">
		<text>Yes, now we will precisely cover. In general he wants to surrender to the authorities. Has probably decided to hand over the secrets in exchange for a way out of the Zone. More shortly Streloks, is now in the Cordon, on the military man to a post. Protection there very serious, to one you not to consult. So you will be waited there by a small group. Children all veterans, skilled, do not refuse their help. Beast should have the list of customers, so find it and bring it to me</text>	<!-- 'Animal' changed to 'Beast' - Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16 -->

And so wanted nuts on them, yes was not in time, it is sick quickly they skedaddle. And I think, what to me business to them, not mine, and figs with it. Now it is clear that they bore. Listen, descend here parking of Mercenaries at once behind village with bloodsuckers. There the base at them, can there the Bloodsuckers and will find. At the same time business good you will make, painfully to play pranks they lately became, a lot of our brothers of the stalker from their hands was lost. Here and so mutants flight from the center a rod so also they devils get the habit a robbery to be engaged.

		<text>Marked One, I shouldn't even be telling you this. Approximately several months ago a group of scientists, with support from above, obtained a permit to search Lab X-10, which is located in the Radar. I, in every possible way, tried to stop them. Explaining that the territory was unstudied and chances of reaching the lab alive were unknown. I suggested that we first complete the study of lab X-16. To understand better how quickly PSI influences affect the brain and to design counter measures. But unfortunately they wouldn't listen to me. Weeks have past and nothing has been heard from them. I am inclined to think the worst</text>

	<string id="sahar_speak_group_4">
		<text>This is strange, Doctor, when I went to disconnect the Brain Scorcher I didn't find any group there, and saw no trace of these people. Well there were Monolithians, but they are fanatics not people</text>

		<text>Listen, Marked One, in the first meeting with DeJames I saw at it a certain plan. I then did not understand much and did not know, but you know, memory at me good, especially visual. And so when you to me have brought my case, in it lay not only my documents, but also documents of DeJames. In them that is mentioned casually about what plan, also one mercenary on a nickname of Tamaz there is mentioned. As I have understood, it was someone like the foreman at LeHavre, and just through it and its brigade LeHavre liquidated objectionable to it people. One of these days I was reached by the information that the rests of a gang of LeHavre gather on a dump. Most likely Tamaz will be there. If there is a plan burner it should be at Tamaz.

		<text>I and thought. Yes, Marked One, business to you is. It is necessary for me, that you have found rare enough Artefact. It is called 'Gold Chunk'. To find it is possible only near Chernobyl, most likely it is necessary to look in North Chernobyl (in a courtyard). Find me 10 pieces, and I will tell about one secret passage. North Chernobyl in the Sarcophagus and back. You will make?</text>

		<text>Both! So quickly? The good fellow. Here look: I will note to you an entrance with North Chernobyl in the Sarcophagus in your PDA, and here pass from the Sarcophagus on North Chernobyl to be in a room with the Monolith. It is necessary to look a little. Well, good luck, my friend</text>

Yes not simple, in them a lot of the valuable information on Chernobyl and that the main thing, on the Monolith! As if at it even the hypothesis was that this stone not a terrestrial origin. Well after you in the Sarcophagus to rustle have guided that, moreover and burner have disconnected, in Chernobyl the landing of fighters has landed at support from air. Well those have left a Monolith who on cleverer, Bloodsuckers what have collected to eat yes with secret tracks. Our hero too has set. But here something at it on road has occurred that it has not carried away the diaries with itself, and has hidden. My people have found it, yes have shaken properly, in general it has broken up, I will tell on truth, I wanted to catch for a long time these diaries, to me about them my person from a Monolith told. And so it has hidden them in three different places in Chernobyl, in a courtyard. You understand about what I will ask? Yes it should is necessary to descend and bring their these diaries to be 3 pieces. You will make?</text>

	<string id="dyak_nebo_help_1">
		<text>Hello Marked One, We are from the group 'Clear sky', this territory is considered ours</text>

	<string id="dyak_nebo_help_2">
		<text>I understand</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dyak_nebo_help_3">
		<text>Though the territory is considered ours, a lot of key points are held by strong groups of bandits. I sent one of my men to observe their camp nearby, but he has not returned. I fear he has been captured or maybe even killed. The men believe that our man is still alive and want to make a rescue attempt. As you can see we are few in number and I have a twisted ankle and can't lead the attack. You are an obviously skilled stalker. If you will lead this attack, I will be in your debt</text>

		<text>How did you get captured?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="saha_nebo_help_3">
		<text>I was watching the bandit camp and nothing was really happening so I decided to wash my socks. I put my weapon down and started cleaning when I heard a bloodsucker roar. It was after me so I ran, and in my panic I ran into this base and became a captive. The bandits were howling with laughter at me, it was quite humiliating</text>
	</string>
	<string id="saha_nebo_help_4">
		<text>Yes, well we need to get out of here before any more bandits arrive</text>

	<string id="dyak_nebo_help_done_3">
		<text>It's not to far from here, you go on a straight line past the church, then past a tower, and then you will see our outpost in a small farm, behind that is a portal, it takes you to our base. Wait, I will put it your PDA an approximate location of the farm</text>

	<string id="kalmyak_vstrecha_first_1">
		<text>One more thief caught, it was a good idea to set that trap. You think you can just walk in anywhere you like and take what you want?</text>

	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_vstrecha_first_9">
		<text>It's nothing like that, an anomaly has formed a portal around the container. We need you to find a way to get it</text>

	<string id="kalmyak_vstrecha_second_0">
		<text>That was a little tricky but here it is, the 'container'</text>

	<string id="kalmyak_vstrecha_second_1">
		<text>I didn't expect you to return. I thought you would run away</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_vstrecha_second_2">
		<text>I told you I was no thief, do you believe me now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_vstrecha_second_3">
		<text>Yes, I believe you. Here, this has all been a misunderstanding</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_0">
		<text>Why do you live in the middle of the marsh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_1">
		<text>Why?, I grew up not far from here. When all this madness, called the Zone, began I was conscripted into a local protection group. I had not long been married and was expecting my first-born. I was stationed on the perimeter, the Zone wasn't as large then. And here it comes... The letter, my wife has radiation sickness. My village was lied to by the government who told them it was safe to stay there. I have to go and see my wife, but the young officer denies my request. I lost my mind and grabbed my weapon and shot down all who tried to stop me. I walked into the hospital with my clothes covered in blood, the AK-47 in my hands. There my Grandma sat, and I ask 'Where is my Katka', and she points to the sign: 'Mortuary', I... I go in there. There she lies... So BEAUTIFUL</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_2">
		<text>kalmyak please calm down</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_3">
		<text>It was so quiet, and then, beside Katka, I found the baby so small, pink cheeks, and eyes same as me. I held his lifeless body to my chest and slumped into a corner and wept. Sat there for I don't know how long. The military Police came to arrest me, I didn't resist. I was taken back to the camp and locked in a cell</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_4">
		<text>Then what happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_5">
		<text>Next day a big group of Mutants attacked our section of the perimeter and broke through the defence. Gunfire everywhere, screams and roars, panic everywhere. The guards had fled, leaving me to my fate. My comrade Fedor came to my rescue and shot the lock open. He handed me a weapon and told me to run. Since then the Zone has been my home, I have nothing to go back to. Here I make ointments out of Mutant Glands and local plant life, there healing properties are amazing. If you ever need some I trade for vodka or cigarettes</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_6">
		<text>Life has not been fair to you kalmyak. The truth is, that's what brought me to your camp; to buy some ointment</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_znakomstvo_7">
		<text>I will not tell you the recipe. Simply remember, it reduces radiation and stops bleeding</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_change_0">
		<text>Greetings kalmyak, I've come for some ointment</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_change_1">
		<text>You have vodka or cigarettes? Remember, one jar of ointment, for 3 bottles of Vodka, or 3 packs of cigarettes</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_change_2">
		<text>Here are the cigarettes</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kalmyak_change_3">

	<string id="digger_repair_1">

		<text>Well here look as the newcomer</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_repair_7">
		<text>How do you even wear this suit in this condition? I will need to change all the armor plates</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_repair_8">
		<text>It's quite good, I thank you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="digger_repair_9">

	<string id="digger_repair_10">

	</string>
	<string id="digger_repair_11">
		<text>Yes please that there at us:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_0">
		<text>Are you the twin brother of Sidorovich?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_1">
		<text>What!!, I've been in this Zone from the very beginning. And you can tell Sidorovich that one day I will feed him to the local marsh giant. Do you know who the first was to supply arms in the Zone? Me that's who!!! I was the first trader who could organise deliveries of everything, both products, and weapons, and medicines. Yes the Barman was my assistant. All business with the fighters was in these hands. But that Son of a dog managed to bribe major Serebrjannikova, and all who were connected with me departed. It wasn't long before this 'rat' had me pushed out of my bunker, yes-yes the same bunker where now this hamster lives. Together with people like Borov he had me thrown out onto the street. I'm still alive though, much to the disapointment of Sidorovich. But here there are kind people. I have survived, though I have a bad limp. But I will return someday and spit on his vile corpse!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_2">
		<text>Vasily that's some story, I didn't mean any disrespect. Now that we have got that out of the way, do you do repairs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_3">
		<text>Yes this is my shop, but I can't get anything done in my condition</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_4">
		<text>And what's wrong?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_5">
		<text>My Foot aches, especially at night. The wound doesn't heal... So bad that it keeps me from doing my job</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_6">
		<text>Well, can I help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_7">
		<text>Yes there is a local man, kalmyak, who makes these fine ointments. Ive had some before, but now I'm in such bad shape that I can't make the trip myself</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_8">
		<text>I will go and get the ointments for you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vasil_first_9">

		<text>Five years ago I found out I had an ulcer, well I never got treated. I just took something for the pain and I could bear it. In the last couple of months it's gotten unbearable. The kalmyak gave me some ointment but it doesnt work on ulcers</text>

	<string id="sveeblov_privet_dialog_0">
		<text>Hello, are you the leader of this faction?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_privet_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, for the last six months, yes I am. We are the faction 'Clear sky'. Our purpose is to study the Zone, but not like other scientists. More truly, we have different interests and a different vision of it's future</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_privet_dialog_2">
		<text>And in what way are you different? In my opinion, all the problems that the Zone poses to mankind are because of scientists</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_privet_dialog_3">
		<text>Yes, the majority, but not all. There are fanatics like the Monolith type. There are others, whos intentions are not clear... We are not fanatics, we don't pray to anybody, but also we have not come here to get rich. We really study the Zone, we don't answer to any goverment, that's the main difference. Its both our advantage, and also a disadvantage</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_privet_dialog_4">
		<text>And so you have little faith in the people in power</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_privet_dialog_5">
		<text>Yes actually, but we are ready to co-operate with them. That's if they have the right intentions. But, I think, their scientific research is still focused on producing cheap electric power and even worse the production of new weapons of mass destruction. We, most of all, are afraid of that. In a Zone full of vicious mutants and deadly anomalies, Man is still the most dangerous</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_0">
		<text>So you absolutely don't communicate with other scientists in any way?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_1">
		<text>Well why should we? We support informal contacts to some scientists, in particular with professor Kruglov. We are not rich, and sometimes we don't have the necessary equipment. Here we do mostly field work. At a stage when a laboratory is required, we contact the scientists. By the way, do you want to work for science?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_2">
		<text>What kind of work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_3">
		<text>Lately, we have observed a certain mutation among a species of mutant. We don't know how its all connected. We don't have any specimans for research</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_4">
		<text>What kind of mutant are you talking about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_5">
		<text>In the northwest of the marsh we have found a different type of controller. It's necessary to get a part of this mutant. We need to examine its brain, I think you understand what needs to be done</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_6">
		<text>Well, I'm not against the work of science, give me the data and I will go search</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_end_0">
		<text>I brought the brain of the controller, you want to see it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_end_1">
		<text>Let's take a look... Yes, an unusual copy. Very large</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_end_2">
		<text>Thats the job done, what kind of reward do I get for dragging this big melon all the way across the marsh</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_first_zadan_end_3">
		<text>Yes certainly, certainly. Here, take this. I wanted to tell you, if you find any unusual mutant parts, with great pleasure I will buy them from you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_0">
		<text>Look, I brought something interesting for you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_1">
		<text>Let's see what you have...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_2">
		<text>A pair of red bloodsucker tentacles</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_3">
		<text>A red burer's hand</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_4">
		<text>Sorry, Sviblov, I don't have anything today</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_5">
		<text>Uh you, an unusual copy. Here, take in exchange</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_change_6">
		<text>The first time I've see such an interesting copy. Yes, this is for you</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_need_0">
		<text>Sviblov, what's on your mind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_need_1">
		<text>I want to start sending the men on regular patrols, but we lack the firepower to deal with large mutants</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_need_2">
		<text>Do you have any ideas?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_need_3">
		<text>I do know where there is a PKM heavy machine gun. When my men patrolled near the abandoned farm the bandits, who have recently occupied the place, opened fire on them with the weapon. We are not as strong as we were before our unsuccessful attempt to break through to the Zone center. We lost our founder, Lebedev, and the majority of our veterans in that operation. Bandits have taken advantage of our weakness and control key points in the marsh. We somehow manage to hold this base and the approaches, also the 'Hunters' have helped us. If you can steal this machine gun it well help solve our problems. But I need you to do it with stealth</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_need_4">
		<text>So you suggest I remain unseen?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_need_5">
		<text>I have no love for bloodshed, we only use our weapons as a last resort. So try to get it without being noticed. One of my men already waits for you, talk with him. he will tell you all the details</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kashei_weapons_need_0">
		<text>Greetings, how are you doing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kashei_weapons_need_1">
		<text>Greetings, you were sent by Sviblova? Their strength and positions are as follows, seven: four in the street and three more in the building. As you will make your the way onto the farm - search for a backpack, they store the weapon in it</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kashei_weapons_need_2">
		<text>Your not going with me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kashei_weapons_need_3">
		<text>Together, we would make too much noise</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kashei_weapons_need_4">
		<text>Well, then wait for me here</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_est_0">
		<text>I bought the weapon</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_est_1">
		<text>What happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sveeblov_weapons_est_2">
		<text>Things didn't go quite as planned. During the most interesting moment 'Hunters' arrived and a gunfight ensued. But I managed to get the machine gun</text>

		<text>What are you talking about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_first_speak_5">
		<text>Dan spoke to you about the Monolithians? I was the first to have noticed something was wrong. The Monolith have become more active. At first they were sighted on the Agroprom, then I personally saw them in the Dark Valley. I've also tracked them directly to the Radar, I had to abort that recon operation as I got a bad case of radiation sickness. I was not ready for such a campaign. Since then my health has failed. Now I have seen them here, one of them has died in a highly radioactive Zone. We need to search the corpse for some information. Believe me, if these fanatics have conceived something, things could end badly for all of us</text>

		<text>Why should I believe anything you say, you agents leave a trail of innocent bodies wherever you go. I think I should rise and leave or first put a bullet in your forehead</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_first_speak_7">
		<text>You are right, I served in the KGB. Enough bad things have happened to me. I had to disappear and where else better than the Zone. The only thing waiting for me out in the world is a bullet in the temple, or cyanide in my coffee, it all depends on the imagination of my 'friends'. The Zone is my home now, so that's why I want to find out what the Monolith are up to</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_first_speak_8">
		<text>Well, let's assume I believe you. What's next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_first_speak_9">
		<text>Well first of all we need to examine that body. I was observing the 3 Monolithians marking a map. They went in different directions, I followed one. He went through a radioactive Zone and was quickly overcome and collapsed. Like I already explained before I would go myself but for me it's certain death. My system just cant handle the trauma yet and I would be dead in minutes</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_first_speak_10">
		<text>Alright, show me the place</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_first_speak_11">
		<text>Let's go, only take your time, it's difficult for me to walk quickly. I will take you to the place, there will be a ruined house, in the ruins look for a corpse</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_second_speak_0">
		<text>Here Cat, I found a map</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_second_speak_1">
		<text>Let me see that. So it's a map of the bogs. Strange, I don't understand what they were doing. What are these marks for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_second_speak_2">
		<text>Well so?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_second_speak_3">
		<text>They have marked here one place, one more place in the southwest, here are figures, here are measurements - height, width and length. And here the rest... Alright, I now go to the bar at camp 'Clear Sky' to think about what we should do. Let's go, we will settle our affairs there</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_first_speak_0">
		<text>Well, Cat, have you received medical treatment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_first_speak_1">
		<text>Yes, but here only Vodka rescues. You know that radiation influences the brain, earlier I would have quickly worked out those plans you found. Now my brain is constantly clouded with fog</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_first_speak_2">
		<text>So, what will we do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_first_speak_3">
		<text>Well, actually, what we need to do is find the other two Monolithians, probably we can learn more from them</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_first_speak_4">
		<text>How will we find them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_first_speak_5">
		<text>Here on base 'Clear sky' they have the equipment that might help us find the remaining Monolithians. Go to the communications room and ask the officer if he can locate them, probably, they will be on their own network signal. When you find them, bring me any information you find and we will analyze it together</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_0">
		<text>Welcome, what is it you want?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_1">
		<text>I need to find two people, can you help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_2">
		<text>I understand, you want to trace them. Who do you want to find?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_3">
		<text>Two Monolithians. I have a PDA from a Monolithian, you can link the signal to the others?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_4">
		<text>Well well, I can help you, give me the PDA, but in exchange you should render me a service</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_5">
		<text>What do you want?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_6">
		<text>I am fond of electronics. I managed to get a TV set, but the picture tube has gone kaput. Could you get me another TV?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_7">
		<text>Where am I gonna find a TV? If I get you this TV, are you sure you can locate the people I'm looking for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_8">
		<text>I've done it before, so I think the second time will be easier</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_first_9">
		<text>Alright, I will go and find you a TV</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_second_0">
		<text>Well, did you bring it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_second_1">
		<text>Yes, here take it. Not new, of course, but the Zone shops are closed</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_second_2">
		<text>Thank you, now let's take a look for those signals. I have picked up some suspicious signals. I have narrowed it down to five places, where there are signals. I can't be more precise than that, on the bogs strong radiation interferes. I will put in your PDA the co-ordinates of these places. Sorry, it looks like it's necessary for you to run about</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tv_need_second_3">
		<text>I knew it wasn't going to be easy, thanks anyway</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_second_speak_0">
		<text>Hello Cat, I found a notebook on one of the Monolithians</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_second_speak_1">
		<text>This is interesting, very interesting. They are planning to construct something, but I can't tell what it is yet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_second_speak_2">
		<text>What's next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kot_nebo_second_speak_3">
		<text>I need to study these notes some more. I'm sure you have other affairs to attend to, do you know the bar '100 X-ray'? I will meet you there later and we will discuss this further</text>

		<text>Greetings wanderer, have a rest. We are always glad to see good people</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_2">
		<text>I am tired, its a long journey to reach your camp. Whats that smell? Something burning?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_3">
		<text>Dammit!, I've burnt it again!... What will I feed the men?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_4">
		<text>That's quite a stench... What were you cooking?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_5">
		<text>The brothers brought in a wild boar, but the meat is tough and stinks when you fry it. The best meat comes from the Pseudogiant. Tastes sort of like chicken, but 100 times better. Listen, are you looking for work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_6">
		<text>Depends on what you want me to do</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_7">
		<text>Its not a dirty job, youll just need to run around a bit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_8">
		<text>Run around? I hope your not going to ask me to go after one of those giant swamp monsters</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_9">
		<text>I don't want you to kill anything. A few days ago some of the men saw a 'Red Pseudogiant' on the Agropom. These are very rare, and their meat... Mind you... even at the best restaurant you couldnt get something as delicious</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_10">
		<text>What is it you want? You want me to slay this beast?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_11">
		<text>I don't want you to kill him. I want you to mark him with this special sniper rifle that shoots a micro-transmitter needle. Then we will send out a hunting party, it will take several men to carry that much meat. So, just mark the 'Red Pseudogiant' and don't kill it. Then return here with the rifle</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_12">
		<text>I Hope you will pay well?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_barman_help_13">
		<text>Don't worry about that. Just take care not to kill him, the thought of that precious meat rotting away brings tears to my eyes</text>

	</string>
	<string id="borman_sniper_dialog_need_5">
		<text>Here's the situation, we hold this side of the bridge and the Monolithians hold the other side. As you can see, the situation is far from stable, these damn mutants and zombies just keep appearing. Our main problem is this Monolith sniper, the Voroshilovsky marksman. This bastard picks off one or two of my men each day. Do you think you can take him out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="borman_sniper_dialog_need_6">

	</string>
	<string id="borman_glushitel_dialog_need_1">
		<text>Yes again your help is needed. Here these devils (Monolithians) jam our radio signal, so we cant communicate with anybody</text>

	<string id="borman_glushitel_dialog_need_2">
		<text>Well Im not a radio engineer, what good could I do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="borman_glushitel_dialog_need_3">
		<text>You have not understood, you need to find the 'muffler'. And here is the most interesting part. We will take the Monolithians small 'muffler' to the Miser, where he will make adjustments so that the 'muffler' blocks the radio signal of the Monolithians. Take the 'muffler' To Miser and then put it back where you found it. Then it will be their turn to suffer</text>

	<string id="borman_glushitel_dialog_need_4">
		<text>Not a bad plan, but where do I search for the 'muffler'?</text>
	</string>

We have dealt with them in the past and they have not always been fair. Therefore I would like to ask you to 'observe' the transaction.

	</string>
	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_9">
		<text>Partly the originator of our problems is you. If not for your careless actions, we would by now have been able to deploy our portable repeaters. Our new psi-installation demands enormous kol-va energy. We don't have such a kol-va energy supply. Certainly, our needs would have been met before the failure of the atomic power station. But now the reactor is destroyed, so it was necessary to try a different way. Besides there is also one more reason, its rather embarrassing... Our 'general' talkative friend, you didn't tell all</text>
	</string>
	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_10">
		<text>Maples or Rabi? Also what didn't you find out in time?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_11">
		<text>Except repeaters, we have ordered some independent generators and, if have received them, could start our installation on total power. And relay a signal in a radius of 200-300 km to begin with. But as I already stated that didn't happen because of you and the lieutenant colonel of FSB Kotova. So for now we are content with the portable psi-aerials, and these are only for protection. Besides, as you already likely know, a spare variant of reception of the boundless power supply - too is in doubt</text>

	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_12">
		<text>It's Cat?...REALLY!!!!, its impossible to trust anybody...the two-faced shit. So what happens now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_13">
		<text>I don't know how, but special services have learned, but not the details, of our plan. Also theres been an influx of agents. One of them your acquaintance, the Cat. And as a further result of your actions our counter-agents and some more people have been killed, the contract will terminate, cargo is destroyed. But never would they think that even children can be agents... As Maples has already told you - and this is an annoying truth - the girl has stolen from us an artefact without which it is impossible to produce an alternative energy source. My people are searching for her, but so far - unsuccessfully. Also I asked them to search, not kill</text>
	</string>
	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_14">
		<text>What further?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="black_doctor_dialog_15">
		<text>Further it's necessary for us to part. For some people the Zone is a source of harm, and for others its a second life. But I have not told you the most important part. I'm afraid that for now its just not the right time. You are awaited by a teleport - go downwards on a ladder - it will transfer you to the first compartment of the destroyed hospital. But before you go - a dream - I hope, it will bring some clearness in your consciousness</text>

	<string id="klyak_need_denis_1">
		<text>You know a long time ago I worked for the Mercenaries. There was one person there that I worked with gathering intel in the Zone. But we didn't share all the information we gathered with the Mercenaries. We established hiding places and stored the intel on flash cards, a part of them directly on documents. After my quarrel with the Mercenaries, it was necessary to stash everything. Until a time I thought it would be safe to retreive them. I sent my old comrade to check up on one of these hiding places. But two days and he has not returned, and also his PDA is silent. Also I sent the Pilgrim long ago to check on a path to the Lost Village, and also no word from him</text>

		<text>No... Denis is a trusted friend. So who has visited us that could have known? Alright, have a rest but not too long. The Astrologer has sent an SMS for you to meet him in the Cordon at the rookie village. I communicated with the Doctor and told him to let the Astrologer know I'm alive. I'm not sure what this guy is up to but we need to be careful with him, he's a smooth operator. I want you to deliver this copy of my map to him</text>
