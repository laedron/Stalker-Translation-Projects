		<text>Ammunition -\n: 7.62x54mm\nCapacity -\n: 100 rounds\n.\nThis extremely rare weapon is found only in heavily armed detachments of Military Stalkers. Because of its large size and weight, it requires the use of Exoskeleton armor, to which it must be physically attached.\nThe original PK Pulemyot Kalashnikova or 'Kalashnikov's Machinegun' was a development of Kalashnikov's automatic rifle design, firing the 7.62x54mmR Eastern Bloc standard ammunition originally from the Mosin-Nagant.\nIt is equipped with a simple bipod, and designed as a squad-level support weapon. It is also suitable for fixed installation and vehicle mounting, and can be used as a light anti-aircraft weapon when fixed to an AA mount.\nMost are belt-fed, using linked 25-round belts, which can be joined together to create any length necessary. Typical of Soviet machine guns, the standard model feeds from the right, and expels its spent cases via an ejection port on the left side of the weapon, contrary to the RH side ejection port on most Western machine guns.\nThe current model is the PKM Kalashnikov's Machinegun Modernized, an improved version of the PK and weighing only 7.5kg when empty</text>

The P90's name is an abbreviation of FN's Project 9.0, in response to NATO requests to replace standard 9x19mm Parabellum firearms. It was designed as a compact but powerful weapon for vehicle drivers, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces and counter-terrorist groups. The P90 has a futuristic appearance, featuring a compact bullpup design and ambidextrous controls, and incorporates several innovations - such as the top-mounted magazine and FN's high velocity 5.7x28mm ammunition. Originally developed between 1986 and 1990, a P90 TR variant was introduced in 1999, featuring a triple rail interface system for mounting accessories. Since 2005, the P90 has been offered to civilians as the PS90, a semi-automatic sporting model with a longer barrel</text>

Further investigation revealed that the missing soldiers were repeatedly insubordinate to their NCOs, and regularly absconded to visit the trader known as Sidorovich, who supplied them with cigarettes and alcohol.\nAccording to their colleagues, they had discovered a hidden passage to the Cordon. The location and approach to this passage are detailed on the attached sketch-map. The searches for my missing soldiers is still ongoing</text>
