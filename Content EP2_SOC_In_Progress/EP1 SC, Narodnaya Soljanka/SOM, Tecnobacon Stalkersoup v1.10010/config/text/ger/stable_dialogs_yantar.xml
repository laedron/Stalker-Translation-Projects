		<text>Thank you... err... Marked One, right? You helped save our associate Kruglov and in order to show my sincere appreciation I would like to present you with one of our working suits. It comes in very handy, you should know that... Could I be of additional help to you?</text>

However, we've designed a screening device to help shield the emission, but to fine-tune it we have to obtain additional measurements.

		<text>Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you. Vasiliev worked on the laboratory problem. About a week ago, he and stalker by the name of Ghost attempted to get inside the laboratory. After several hours we felt a shake and emissions stopped; after another hour, we got a signal from Vasiliev, it was coming from the swamp but then vanished. By the looks of things, Vasiliev is gone. Try to find his body: he had accurate information about the laboratory - where it is and how to get in. He might have also known how to turn off the emissions. The laboratory entrance is most likely hidden in the basement of one of the buildings in the power plant area.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_231">
		<text>You did a splendid job, Marked One! Now that the emissions are turned off, we will be able to order new expeditions and explore previously inaccessible territories. And also... from now on we will conduct a most favorable pricing policy toward you. Oh, I almost forgot... check your PDA, I've uploaded some info about so-called 'artefact modificates'. Hope, you'll find it useful.</text>

	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_31">
		<text>You did an excellent job. If the measurements are correct, the prototype should provide you with maximum protection from emission.</text>

		<text>Glad to hear that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_3111">
		<text>Now your path to the laboratory is clear... except that if the source of the emission isn't destroyed and doesn't lose its power, you may not have enough time to get back. So, my dear Sir, here is the deal. Our calculations have produced an estimated location of the source as well as the fact that it is under ground. With your permission, I have already marked the spot on your map.</text>

	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_311111">
		<text>Vasiliev was working on the lab issue. About a week ago he and a stalker called Ghost tried to get inside. A couple of hours later we felt a major tremor, and after another hour we picked up a signal from Vasiliev coming from the swamp, but it died away. And Vasiliev died away with it, it would seem. Try to find his corpse. He had the exact information on the lab and the way to get into it. There may even be info on deactivating that source of the emission. I've uploaded you all the data we have.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_311112">

	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_311113">
		<text>Perhaps. At any rate, you must start by finding Vasiliev's body - that is the only chance of obtaining accurate information about the lab's location. The body of your colleague, Ghost, must be somewhere there as well. You know, it seemed to me like he knew a lot more about X-16 than he admitted to us. Had he somehow survived... Well, it's no use holding on to that hope, of course.</text>

		<text>Here is a prototype, be careful with it. It's not calibrated properly, but that's your fault - you failed to save our colleague.

On the other hand, since two years have passed... But since you are so interested, then I guess I'll start my story. As I said, this happened two years ago. It all began with a scientific congress in Berlin, the main theme of which was the area and its impact on the environment. As a result, it was decided to equip a scientific expedition to the Zone, led by leading scientific experts, to gather information and study the nature of the Zone. Shortly found sponsors who have agreed everything with the Government of Ukraine and three months later began preparations for the expedition at a military base on the edge of Chernobyl. Ah, then here came all the light of the scientific world, known foreign and domestic scientists: physicists, chemists, biologists, ecologists.</text>

		<text>In general I know it. Further.</text>

		<text>Was zakuplena Curb weight: different devices, spetsoborudovanie, mobile laboratories, protective clothing, etc. As of Government has allocated us two special police troops and even special BTR'y. Also in the expedition were to participate Stalker guides, translators and even journalists. In general, after a two-week training and mentoring expedition to the Zone in the City-32. That it should have this happen! The day before the shipment I got sick and had to lie down for four days in the hospital that, in theory, and saved my life. A as I was sorry about that I can not yet go to the expedition, as envious colleagues... I then promised that after his recovery will be me by helicopter to the scientific camp. Meanwhile, the expedition reached the town of-32. Helicopter thrown back cell research camp, like the one in which you are now, have established a relationship with the base and took up the study. At first, everything went perfectly. We started to measure the radiation level, to study various features of the anomalies, the chemical composition of artefacts. Every day we receive regular reports from the camp of the new discoveries and otkrytiyax - in the success of the expedition no doubt. Meanwhile, I lay on a cot in the infirmary, and kicking themselves...</text>

		<text>But soon the camp began to take place weird things. Cnachala we noticed excessive aggressiveness and irritability in the voices on the radio, but did not attach much importance to the nerves, then not all the iron. 3atem somewhere lost two special. Three days after the beginning of the expedition, we received a message stating that one of the scientists, Professor Rosenberg is overly agitated state, committed suicide by shooting himself. This news shocked us! And two days later sank a radio message from the camp. We stayed in complete bewilderment, it was decided to send a helicopter to the camp, but because of the strong storm that was not possible. We could do was wait. A day later we received a message from the two stalkers who have seen the night a group of people on BTR'e at Rotten Woods, in an ambush the bandits. The military sent there immediately written special ops. What happened there, you have already told all stages, I can only add that survived the ambush, three members of the expedition, hidden in the woods. When we found them, they were more like animals than people - the wild, frightened, bedraggled. They initially looked like a patient in a psychiatric hospital, not even hard to believe that a week ago they were still normal. It took about a month intensive treatment to at least partially restore their psyche.</text>

	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_story_291">
		<text>After analyzing the incident and the stories of survivors, the commission concluded that the cause of death of the expedition was the psychotropic radiation of unprecedented power, which in the zone called 'vyzhigatelem brain. " As a result of a long stay under this radiation in humans began to break down psyche: appeared unprecedented aggression, rage and savagery. Some could not cope with the psychological stress and kill themselves as poor Professor Rosenberg. Some poured out aggression on others, attacked them and killed like mad animals. The camp started in shambles. A still here and mutants arrived, using the lack of protection. Those who have not yet completely mad, trying to return to BTR'e, but halfway was ambushed by bandits and killed in a shootout. So it died expedition to City-32... Since then, I vowed not to leave the zone until you have learned it damn radiation and can not find protection from him... Hy, Spot, I spoke here with you, it's time for work.</text>

		<text>Professor, you have any useful info about mutants?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_story2_1">
		<text>Yes, certainly - here Kruglov's last report on poltergeists.</text>

		<text>So. What we know about the poltergeist:\n1. This is (presumably) the people that are in force ogromnoy ejection. They are higher telepaths can subdue the people, animals, mutants, partially - controllers.\n2. Do not be visible in the physical appearance. According to the stalkers out of their heads - leaky storm or fire education. Nobody knows what happens after death the soul is also not known whether they all kill.\n3. Telekinetic abilities vary. They can throw objects, from small to as much iron doors.\n4. Establish a link between reproductive telepathy. Initially slated to appear Poltergeist. From him is the controller, it is unknown how, presumably - the controller is a person for a long time been under the influence of the poltergeist, poltergeist where reason and man weave, and at some point, the controller aborts poltergeist out of his mind. Controller then regresses in byurera. Information Concerning received from scientists in the center of the zone, the link that was lost 2 years ago.\n5. Supposed to live in caves, although the effect was found throughout the zone.\n6. Energy analysis of the controller found Energosvyaz with higher intelligence. Presumably, poltergeist. So, poltergeist can kill violating energy balance its essence...</text>
