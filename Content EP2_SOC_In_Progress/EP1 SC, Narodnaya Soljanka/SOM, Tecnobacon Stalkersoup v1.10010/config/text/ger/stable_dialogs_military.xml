		<text>I come back, then the other day from Lake Amber in Yantar with the swag. And the night was nearly dark. And all around silence. I do not know how anyone, but just when the silence in the Zone, that's when I became afraid and not on it's own. Walking on a footpath - up a hill to the highway. A couple times I went there. Anomalies here a little, and on the highway and there are no - nuts, bolts and other trash did not throw at his feet. Coming, then, as bushes along the road just let the trees. And then you hear me from afar, not that very far away ... Locality something open, and his voice echoes over long distances, so it was hard to determine. In short, I pull out the bolt and into the bushes it. It seems to be pure. I waded through those same bushes and 400-500 meters away near one of the marshes can see the shape. And a twinkle in her hand. Looks like an artifact. But the shouting, then it is not joy. From this swamp is something moving on it. Another figure. Bent, arms stretched forward, drawn to the stalker. And then one more after the first climbs out of the swamp.</text>

		<text>Stalker stirred, stretched, automatic shoot, recharge, but managed to make just a couple of shots. These creatures walked and walked on it. They surrounded him, and he disappeared among them. My hand is in itself also reached out to my machine, but I realized that nothing can be done. I picked up and gave a tear, as darkness has enveloped all around. The next day I find out that the stalker Anton, named Talon, disappeared. Amber lake took him and thus never returned. They say that a stalker has been experienced. That's what greed does to a man. But he knew that going there is very dangerous.</text>
