The base has only one entrance and it is well guarded. We thought of busting a hole in the fence, but their sniper in the tower won't let us. I don't want to send my guys to catch his bullets... but you - he'll let you come close and definitely won't shoot on sight. If you take him out, we'll owe you.

	</string>

		<text>I was returning from Yantar lake with loot. It was getting dark, and everywhere was quiet. I never like it when there's total silence in the Zone, you don't know what's going to happen next... I stuck to the path, then up a slope to the main road, where I knew there weren't a lot of anomalies. So I relaxed and stopped throwing bolts before taking a step. I walked for a while before hearing someone's voice close by. Well, it may not have been close but the area was open with no trees, so the sound could have travelled from further. Anyway, I took a bolt and threw it into some bushes. No anomalies there, so I made my way to where I thought the voice was and about 400-500 metres away I saw the figure of someone close to something like flames. Maybe it was an artefact, but the reason he shouted wasn't for joy because suddenly I saw something heading for him, another figure, with arms out like a zombie. And then another one, followed by another, and another crawling out of the swamp towards him...</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_4">
		<text>Wow, as if we didn't have enough mutants, there are swamp monsters around now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_5">
		<text>The Stalker tried to move away. He even had time to pick up his gun, shoot, and reload. He did this about two or three times, but it was useless. These things just kept heading for him until they surrounded him and he disappeared under this fucking heap of bodies... Only then did I get myself together and ran away...\nThe next day I heard that a Stalker named Anton Claw had vanished. He'd gone to Yantar lake and didn't return. It's the Zone's way of saying that you mustn't be greedy. But he must have known that's a really dangerous area, even in the evening...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_6">
		<text>Hmm... Thanks for the story. The next time I'm in Yantar, I'll be more careful...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_0">
		<text>Do you have any advice to offer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_1">
		<text>Advice? Well, okay... Once this fool joined us to visit the central part of the Zone. If we stopped for a rest, he would immediately sit down and get his kit off. And when we got up to continue he'd be the last one up. And that's when a Bloodsucker caught him alone and pumped him dry without anyone hearing them... So the moral is: if you're going to be slow in the Zone, then be slow to let your guard down... You should always be ready. If you hear only a small rustle in the bush - shoot immediately about half way up, and only then go to find out what it was. And about Controllers - they can only catch you if they see you, so fall down immediately if you spot one. If everything's quiet - wait longer. The first to make a sound or movement is the loser... And get as far from this place as fast as you can - it's the only way you'll stay alive...</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_1">
		<text>A Stalker came here recently, and told us a story. He loved to thoroughly explore parts of Zone that were new to him, and got into all sorts of places. He found a hole that looked like a small tunnel or cave - the kind that are all over the Zone. It was dark inside so he turned on his torch. That was when he saw the Controller at the far end. It was too late to turn and run, so he decided to do the next best thing - run right up to the bastard and shoot it with his Kalashnikov... Well, he pulled the trigger and it jammed, so he reloaded. It misfired again, and the Controller hit him with a mind blast... He was right up close to the Controller but couldn't fire, so he reversed his rifle and used it as a club. Long story short, he killed the Controller. Smashed its head in so it couldn't blast him. He said the only thing that saved his life was that the Controller was drunk - there were cases of vodka everywhere...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_2">
		<text>I reckon he lied - Controllers don't drink vodka...</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_3">
		<text>Maybe, but that Stalker's been selling vodka at a good price ever since...</text>

		<text>Oh. What kind of test?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_7">
		<text>No, it's much easier, but you must do it at night. And it needs your total concentration and composure, so if you make a mistake, you won't pass. It's in three stages, so listen carefully...\nThere's a herd of wild boar that sleeps around here at night, just beyond the wall. Your first stage is to hide and wait for them all to fall asleep without disturbing them. The second stage is get through the herd and close enough to the pack leader to touch it, but without waking it up. Okay so far? Good. Now the third and final stage is to kick it as hard as you can so that it wakes up. You then need to count ten out loud, and come back to the camp. Once you get through the gate, everyone'll be there to congratulate you. Okay?</text>

	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_8">
