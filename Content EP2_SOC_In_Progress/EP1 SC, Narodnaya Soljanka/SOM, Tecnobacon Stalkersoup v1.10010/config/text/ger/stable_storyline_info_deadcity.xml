		<text>I don't know what to feel... I've found out that I'm the Shooter. One who lost his memory in one of the last pathways to the center of the Zone. Who lost all his friends except for the Doctor. And who discovered something that made him dangerous. What did I find out?\nNext question... The Doctor managed to save the key and the location of our group's secret stash in Pripyat. It's located in one of the hotel rooms in the center of the city. He says that there should be something in there that'll shed light on the 'Wish Granter', or Monolith. He also said that after my last scouting to the Chernobyl NPP, I kept saying there was something really shady about the Monolith. Well, Monolith, we're going to deal with you. What are you, and who made you?</text>

		<text>Doctor: When we last met, you left me a key to the secret stash in Pripyat. There was also a map showing where to find it. I saved them both... I never showed them to the Mercs... Maybe you'll find something there... You also kept mumbling that there was something underhand about the Monolith. Well, that much is for sure!</text>
