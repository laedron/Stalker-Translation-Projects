	<string id="dm_action_info_0">
		<text>You want news? How can there be anything new here? Think of this as kindergarten; maybe preschool even. 'Course, if you don't hang around here, you'll get wasted in five minutes out in the Zone. The smart ones stay here a while, and then they go fuck-knows-where. Besides, you can make it here with just a weapon and some ammo. No question about it. Everyone does it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_1">
		<text>All I have to do is wait for those pussies in uniform to go out for lunch at the Military Base... There's no point hanging out here. I need to go to the Big Land, but they won't let me, no matter what. I'm not the only one trying to get out, but we still can't slip by them yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_10">
		<text>Not far from here, recently, the boys in uniform came looking for something. They never used to come around here, but recently they cleared everything out spick-'n'-span, right down to cutting down the power lines. And now it seems they found something... I couldn't even get close to the building. They noticed me right away and opened up. Glad I made it out without a hole in my hide.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_100">
		<text>Nothing. Just trying to make it, that's all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_11">
		<text>We're getting together a team of tunnel rats who can't get enough of climbing underground in the Zone. There's an old factory, and under it there are all these power lines. They say there's a bunch of goodies there, always something new to check out. Very interesting...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_12">
		<text>Not new - old! They say that Strelok's old base used to be here. I wonder what kind of leftovers one could find from that area, if they really looked hard?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_13">
		<text>Can you believe it? An hour ago I almost got wasted! I was here six months ago - there was peace and quiet, but now these razorheads in their outfits are under every bush! It's crazy, man...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_14">
		<text>You're lucky that the bandits didn't get you. They have a base pretty close to here. I would have eliminated it if I could've... But for now we're just observing. This is their supporting base - the headquarters is located closer to the center of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_15">
		<text>They say that there used to be an impressive Lab here, well hidden from sight... On the one hand, it'd be great to find the entrance - I bet there are lots of goodies inside. On the other hand, it gives me the heebie-jeebies...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_16">
		<text>Did you know that in what's now called the Dark Valley, before the Incident, there used to be an underground Scientific Research Complex? I don't know what it was meant for, but rest assured, it was nothing good. They say different things about it, but mostly bad stuff. Terrible place...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_17">
		<text>And what? What do you want to hear? I'll tell you this much: the Duty guys are definitely the cops, and they know how to keep order, that's for damn sure. But overall I don't like them very much. They're like dictators everywhere: "Don't take this, don't carry that" out of the Zone. Not only that, but they've already determined what you're allowed to say in the Big Land and what you're supposed to be hush-hush about! They blabbed that they actually want to destroy the Zone, little by little. Well, that doesn't surprise me, coming from former soldiers... Bunch of idealists. What's worse is that they say their support comes all the way from the top.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_18">
		<text>This territory is now controlled by Duty, and the rules of Duty are the law of the land. We control the borders of the Zone and cool off any hot-heads. The poor fools come here in whole caravans - amateurs, romantics, opportunists - and then they die off in large groups their very first day in the shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_19">
		<text>Were you at our half-way camp? Granted, it's not JUST ours; you can run into all kinds of people there. What's important is that it's a good place, without any trash, and all the news about the Zone trickles in there. You can almost always hear something useful, or at least shoot the shit with good folks about nothing in particular. Too bad that Baldy and his group left the day before yesterday. This time I didn't even get to see him before he took off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_2">
		<text>Let's head to camp. I'm sure you'll get your fill of the local rumors there. Everybody who's new to the Zone - the rookies, like you - usually drop by to pick up some pointers or rest a while. There are soldiers posted just down the road; don't be too afraid of them, but don't give them any shit, either. They will waste you and not think twice about it. Here by the trader - well, the "retailer of the local merchandise" - there's a nice, calm little place where you can hang out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_20">
		<text>Right now, this place is safe, and we're trying to keep it that way. There are many people here: some who've made it their home and don't go beyond the surrounding area, others who are preparing for yet another raid. It's a real shame that Irokez didn't come back. He loved to set rookies like yourself on the "path of righteousness."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_21">
		<text>Did you hear that Duty has announced it's recruiting new members? I thought about it for a minute, but then decided - fuck that! Before long they'll draft me... Don't need that kind of discipline again. I served my two years, and that was enough for me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_22">
		<text>If you haven't heard yet, I'm letting you know: we're recruiting new members. If you have some experience, come. You won't regret it. At the base, ask for Petrenko.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_23">
		<text>Did you come to watch the matches, too? Want to place a bet or something? Well, what do you know! There's an Arena here somewhere. So, get this: members of the Duty squad catch mutants for the scientists, right? After the research, if the freaks are still alive, they let 'em loose in the Arena. And these babies come in all shapes and sizes. Some, you'll look at them and die laughing, others - you'll piss your pants!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_24">
		<text>They just provided the Arena with fresh meat. Entertainment for the people, and for us an easy way to earn a few bucks from the bets. We'll prove to the rest of the Stalkers that Duty isn't just wagging its tongue, but that we're the real deal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_25">
		<text>Hey, listen, you been to Rostok? It used to be quiet there, but now it's tough going there alone - your average wild field, way too many mutants there now. Let's go together, what do you say? On the other hand... I don't know you, and you don't know me. What if... Yeah, dude, sorry. Let's split, and go our own way...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_26">
		<text>We're just back from Rostok. You don't want to show your face there, especially if you're alone. Want to stay alive? Then you'd better not go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_27">
		<text>Well, I was thinking of going to Yantar, but then thought, fuck it. That's where the eggheads set up a full-fledged scientific base in the Zone. They're digging around in fuck-knows-what while zombies are romping all around outside the complex. Jesus, just like Paradise!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_28">
		<text>They were purging the Yantar area recently... Yeah, cleaned it up pretty well! There are research labs there, but too many zombies all around. So we have to haul over there pretty regularly to help the scientists out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_29">
		<text>By the old warehouses, you know - the Freedom base. They're happy-go-lucky guys, have some soul; it's nice to chat with them over a bottle of vodka. And Duty isn't there all the time, like around the Bar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_3">
		<text>There's an old factory nearby. We keep on cleaning it of bandits, and each time those bastards come back again! It hasn't even been a week since last time, and they're already back. You better be careful around there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_30">
		<text>Freedom is hiding out behind the old warehouses. Should break 'em all down, those fuckin' anarchists...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_31">
		<text>Leave before it gets dark! During the day it's more or less okay, but once the sun sets...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_32">
		<text>Stalker... get out of here! We're going to lock the Cordon down. For now, we keep it up only during the day, and leave for the night - it's too creepy here at night.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_33">
		<text>See, during the night you need to keep yourself hidden, and preferably behind a good set of doors. At night we find ourselves pretty much under siege.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_34">
		<text>Well, buddy, it seems you're not up to date. During the night you have to snooze somewhere far away from here. Here, during the night, even a grenade launcher doesn't always help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_35">
		<text>You know what? Let the Duty guys and the Freedom guys and the Mercenaries figure out who this area belongs to. What's it to me? To hell with it all...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_36">
		<text>We're working here now, Stalker. Not only are there a bunch of these mutant wretches breeding here, but also those Mercenary pricks and the retards from the Freedom faction get in the way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_37">
		<text>I have to warn you that it's not very safe here even during the day. Once in a while there's a shoot-out. As far as I understand, there's some long-standing beef between the various local bandit factions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_38">
		<text>Listen, why don't you tell me - this is our territory, right? It's easier for us to hold off the wretches that come here from the center of the Zone, isn't it? The eggheads can mess around trying to figure out who's bothering them, but Duty and the Mercenaries can get the hell out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_39">
		<text>You don't know? They made a new path here to be able to get past the Duty patrol right to the perimeter with all the goods. Get here from Yantar, and then use the back way all the way to Agroprom - and you're there!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_4">
		<text>Nothing. I don't know shit. I grab a bite here and there, trying to make enough for my daily bread. It's too creepy going into the Zone itself - to hell with it. And there's no work at home, my wife's on my case - gotta live somehow. Here at the Garbage, if you poke around for a day, you can get some artefacts together. And it'll do for your bread and butter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_40">
		<text>And why are you here? Planning to go to Yantar, or are you trying to sneak some artefacts past a brother?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_41">
		<text>I won't conceal the fact that from time to time your Stalker colleagues offer us some quite interesting anomalous formations - 'Artefacts' is what you call them. Because of... Shall we say... The uncertain level of control over them... These places form a kind of highly-active smuggling trail.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_42">
		<text>What's wrong with you, man? We laid a path just so that we wouldn't have to run into the guys from the Duty faction if we wanted to get to the Big Land for something. Though they still hang around here from time to time, at least they're in the dark for now and you can get around them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_43">
		<text>I'm just coming back from Yantar. Thought I'd pass something off to the scientists as usual, but they're all locked in their bunkers, don't go out even during the day. So if you're planning to head in that direction, might as well change course.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_44">
		<text>There's research going on in the Yantar zone, but recently there have been more zombies hanging around those parts. So we're defending the entrances.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_45">
		<text>I don't even know what to tell you. I wanted to get back into our complex - it's called Yantar, as you probably know. And now there's this: they say that while before it was just plain dangerous, now it's simply impossible to get through. Think maybe they're exaggerating?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_46">
		<text>I was at Yantar. The scientists are completely holed up there: sneaking around, hiding... They're living on the supplies the helos drop off. There's a shitload of zombies there now. If you spend a week living there among them, you'll start sneaking around yourself. It's that kind of place. Not very pleasant.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_47">
		<text>Fuck that guy! Who does he think he is to be hanging out with zombies constantly walking around? So many of them in the Damn complex - and they keep on coming. There's more and more of them there every day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_48">
		<text>We're trying to stop the movement of zombies from the laboratory complex. Honestly, I wouldn't mind if you joined - we have a shortage of men.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_49">
		<text>You know, we're also gathering various data... For instance, I'm researching the main ways in which the quasilives - that is, "zombies," according to your terminology - are spreading in the Zone. Would you be willing to share your findings?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_5">
		<text>Yeah, that's about it... Some feed off the Garbage, collecting little junk, others penetrate deeper into the Zone. Naturally, you can find much better stuff deeper, but not everyone wants to go. It's no place for rookies, and if you don't have lots of ammo, don't even think about going there - it's suicide.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_50">
		<text>Did you get to shoot at the zombies climbing out of the lab windows? Well, you better watch it - they're not afraid of anything, and don't feel any pain. In other words, they are wretches without any brains.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_51">
		<text>I'm going to apply for a position in the lab. Hey man, relax - I'm kidding! You know that if you wander into those parts, you're as good as dead. Or you'll turn into a zombie. Which is worse?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_52">
		<text>I'm warning you: don't go into the lab. If you really want to go, then go. I'm not gonna hold you back by force. Just saying that people who go don't come back alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_53">
		<text>You see, I would like to warn you. You shouldn't go into the laboratory. Nobody, in fact, should go there: it's linked to major alterations in the psychology and metabolism of an individual, and, I'm afraid, these effects are not reversible.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_54">
		<text>There! Now I'm going to shed some light on you... Enlighten you... Basically, save your hide before you go astray. So here's the deal, man: don't set your sights on the laboratory complex. It's creepy there, very creepy. People disappear there, and then sometimes come back to haunt you at night. Only these aren't some made-up horror stories, but real fucking zombies. That's how it is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_55">
		<text>Have you seen these smartasses, the United Nations forces? Lately they're completely chickening out. Gotta call in a whole regiment along with the air force for protection just to take a few steps off the base.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_56">
		<text>And what's it to you? Don't bother them with stupid questions, and they'll leave you alone as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_57">
		<text>You see, we usually don't leave the bunker without the necessary protection: the conditions of the surrounding territory don't permit it. I'm sort of an exception. I don't really like large expeditions. All the fuss, soldiers... attracts more attention from the things creeping around here. But in any case, I'm afraid I can't tell you anything helpful for the time being.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_58">
		<text>I get a kick out of our happy little scientists! I just totally dig 'em, man. They usually don't show their faces out of the bunker. And when they do - like they did the other day - Damn it! Troops everywhere, helos, armor technology! They might as well haul a battleship here, or at least an armored train.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_59">
		<text>It's already my third day hanging out here, observing. There's a lab here, right? Nobody goes in there anymore. Duty used to purge zombies only on the surface, and now stopped completely. But the scientists used to go in there. That means they found a way to protect themselves, fuck knows how. So I'm thinking, why not snoop around, find out? I bet there are so many goodies in there that you'd have to rake them in with a shovel!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_6">
		<text>In the last few days, whole packs of animals are coming out of the Dark Valley. What's forcing them out of there is unclear, but they're really bugging out, like from a fire. And in the eastern sector the mutants are breeding like flies. All we can do is keep shooting them down. So that's the news.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_60">
		<text>And what are you looking for here? Also trying to get into the lab? What, did you hear a fairy tale about magical instruments and piles of artefacts? Man, when will you boneheads ever learn?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_61">
		<text>I work here, young man. Simply work here, carrying out my obligations to science and humanity. And if you wish to find out how to get inside the abandoned laboratory, I will tell you the same thing that I tell every Stalker I meet: I don't know, and I don't want to know! This topic doesn't interest me and never interested me, is that clear?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_62">
		<text>Maybe the brains really did come up with some sort of new technology. I wonder what's hidden in that damned lab. Even if there aren't any goodies there - it's still interesting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_63">
		<text>I'm wondering - think I should join Freedom? There's their base, in the old Army warehouses. And why not? Seem like pretty smart guys, and so what if they're a bit disorganized? It's even better that way. I don't need to be disciplined, I know what I'm supposed to be doing - it's not like this is my first month here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_64">
		<text>You're not too friendly with Freedom, are you? Fine, fine, don't get your panties in a wad about it. I think that pretty soon we'll run them out of the warehouses. They don't have any organization or any discipline. They're just a big herd of dumb animals; a pack at best. And they dare stand up against us, those wannabes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_65">
		<text>I met up with one of the Duty guys when there was a cease-fire. We shared a few facts. The man was actually pretty smart, but, shit, he had tunnel-vision like a tank. You see, our philosophy is completely different from theirs: you can only tame the Zone - assimilate it - not destroy it. To do that, we need open access to all of the information. Someone will come up with something eventually. But Duty's all about "close it" and "lock it" and "don't spread it around." Retards, complete fucking retards. I guess it makes sense for them: when the political machine controls you, you're not supposed to think outside of the box.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_66">
		<text>There's a little cottage here. Used to be calm, but now there are some bloodsuckers that seem to be breeding there. Better to loop around, so that's where I'm going... Hey man, don't say I didn't warn you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_67">
		<text>I want to warn you, Stalker, right away: bloodsuckers have moved into the village, and maybe something worse, so be careful.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_68">
		<text>There's nothing new. There are no more artefacts here, and bloodsuckers took over those little cottages. We ran them off as best we could. Now I can't even bring myself to go there. Paranoia, maybe, but I can't and that's it. No fucking way. Death is there...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_69">
		<text>I'm getting the fuck out of here! Bummed around for four weeks on the border, and that's it - enough for me! Freaks are constantly coming over here from the direction of the Scorcher, each day more and more of them...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_7">
		<text>How many Stalkers have become "trashmen?" They never used to even look in the piles of garbage - so much radiation that it'll hard-boil eggs in half an hour. But now that it's gotten harder to find goodies, they'll wrap themselves in protection, shoot up some chems, and climb in to look. There's all sorts of stuff that comes up from there, though usually it's junk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_70">
		<text>If you're coming here to help our blockade, I respect you. If not, get the hell out of my sight! We need real men, not pussies. Got enough of those already.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_71">
		<text>You here for the blockade, man? All the better - at least one more normal person will be here. We organized this thing and held it together pretty well... But then all the beasts had to come our way! Now it's tough, and every gun barrel counts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_72">
		<text>Aren't you up to date? The way to the center of the Zone is open! Either it opened on its own or someone pulled off the impossible - either way, it's good for me! Now all we have to do is get in and gather the finest goods!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_73">
		<text>You might have waited, Stalker. Fools rush in. Just tell me: do you know what's over there? Of course you don't. You don't know whether there's anything there or not. What kinds of traps await you? You don't know that, either. Then why the hell are you trying to charge through like a wild animal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_74">
		<text>The way to the center is free, understand? There's a straight path right to it! Now everyone is gonna haul ass over there. What's important is to be among the first, to gather the best fruit!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_75">
		<text>Keep on trucking ahead - you'll see everything yourself! Don't you want to see for yourself what's going on ahead? Well then, you're in luck. There must be a shitload of goods there! You've heard about the Granter of Wishes, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_76">
		<text>Just like children, for Christ's sake! "Wish Granter"; "The Gold Rush for Artefacts"... Can't believe my ears!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_77">
		<text>I want to find out myself what's beyond the horizon, man! What if we'll be able to find out, in one blow, all the explanations for why the Zone is the way it is?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_78">
		<text>Did you see those skyscrapers? That's Pripyat. The station is right behind it. I wish I could get in there... It's hard to tell what's roaming around in there nowadays, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_79">
		<text>Let me explain. There's Pripyat. Behind it - Chernobyl NPP. What's going on there and who's inhabiting those parts is unknown. This is the place for us; we'll find some good things here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_8">
		<text>Not up to date! And I'm just heading towards the Bar to chat with folks. What, you've never been there? Jesus! Just keep on moving north; the Bar's just around the corner. It's very helpful to drop by there, especially for newbies like you. It's, like, prescribed by the doctor. There are experienced men there, and who knows, they may help out, tell you something useful. One thing: you'll run into our buddies from Duty on the way... And if you're lucky, they'll like you. If you're not... well, then they won't.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_80">
		<text>Pripyat! Pinch me, damn it! Finally! From here it's just a little ways to the station. Hard to know what you'll run into here - what critter is sharpening its teeth in the shadows, waiting for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_81">
		<text>Listen, friend... Are you also hearing a voice in your head, or am I hallucinating? Keeps on murmuring something over and over again...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_82">
		<text>Damn, another one. So, here's the deal. I'll try to explain for the billionth time what kind of telepathic effect people here experience. A voice in their heads is constantly calling them towards the center of the Zone promising to grant every wish for the one who is able to touch the... What's it called? Oh yeah, some Monolith.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_83">
		<text>Do you hear a voice? Cool, just like a radio in your head! Shame there's only one station though: "Come to me and you'll have great happiness." Two hours harping on the same damn thing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_84">
		<text>And you can't guess what it is? You're trying to break through to the station, too! Well, so are we - what else is new? Just as long as we can get these retards off the road...</text>
	</string>

		<text>The station's very close! For now we still can't deal with the resistance of the Monolithians, though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_86">
		<text>There it is, Chernobyl NPP, within arms' reach. Just a little bit further, but these motherfuckers are so stubborn, and won't let us through! Well, we'll just have to clear them out!</text>

	<string id="dm_action_info_9">
		<text>Listen, friend, you don't know about the Agroprom? I wanted to go there, but everyone started mocking me: "There aren't any goods there anymore. They cleaned the place a while ago, and now there's only anomalies left." Do you know if they're serious or if they're just saying that to joke around? I'm pretty new here, and I don't know whether to believe what the locals say... Maybe they're all in on it, and just like to mess with us. All they need is someone new to laugh their heads off at, those pricks!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_94">
		<text>Listen! Move fast, but don't rush around blindly. There are Monolithians everywhere. They know the city like the backs of their hands and have put up lots of traps. You need to be careful.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_95">
		<text>I'm warning you: for now, a large portion of the city is controlled by the Monolith faction. Lots of traps - they know the city like men know their wives. Keep a sharp eye out, and check your weapons.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_96">
		<text>Oh, how I'd love to carpet-bomb this whole fucking city! Pricks... The only place they're not hiding is in sand boxes and flower pots. How many people have already died because of these creeps?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_97">
		<text>Listen, about this Wish Granter... Maybe it's not unlimited, so there won't be enough wishes for everybody. And what do you do if you get there? Kneel? Get down on all fours? And you, dude, I promise you this: if we get there, I'm going first!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_98">
		<text>Duty has to break through to the center, if not first then one of the first! Just imagine, Stalker, what if some psycho - and, let's face it, all of you here are psychotic, paranoid, or just plain retarded - gets to the thing that really can grant any wish, huh? What then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_99">
		<text>News of the century: everyone who can walk and carry a weapon is here now! Anything can happen here! Imagine it! Anything that you wish! But what if someone comes along and says, "I want for the Zone to disappear forever?" Can you wrap your head around what will happen? We're all going to end up stranded in the middle of nowhere, all of us!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_0">
		<text>Something new? To hell with your new, when there's so much old shit that you couldn't scoop it out with a ladle. The bandits went nuts, the bastards! We tiptoe between the anomalies trying to get the artefacts, and they're the ones stealing other people's goods... Fucking vultures! Just watch out and don't wander into the Garbage - that's exactly their kind of place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_1">
		<text>I'm stuck here, you got it? Stuck! I want to go home, and they're not letting me. That's all the news. The guys that go deep into the Zone, the ones that have been around, they say different things. And at times they bring the goodies, too - you'd be jealous if you saw 'em. They say that there are places like mounds of gold, all for the taking. Granted, not many will get there, and even less will make it back with the loot.  But still...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_10">
		<text>A week ago Otter burned out on the Scorcher. It'd make sense if it was some green-ass rookie - but he's been a Stalker many years. They say he was even on Strelok's team. And then all of a sudden...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_100">
		<text>Well, I'm not really up to date on all the latest news.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_101">
		<text>These local critters come from all sides! I already think that the more we kill, the more they appear. But nothing but victory will be ours! We have more strongly armed guys, we would have guided the procedure here, but for the dead boys we retaliated</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_102">
		<text>Damn this place. Not the Agroprom area in general. Fight, fight... And with whom and against whom? Cant be normal that mutants so quickly multiply. We kill so many, but they only become more</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_103">
		<text>I've heard that many of the anomalies and artefacts are no longer visible. Perhaps it's because of emissions, they pumped up the energy band too much. So beware: now not so easy to run, the detector is now a matter of life and death. A descriptive artefact can be found only with advanced detectors. Good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_104">
		<text>Khabar looking for. Place here is one of the safest: either you extortionate exactions as a landfill, no crowds mutants, both at the agricultural industry, nor corrupt military. And as anomalies and rare creatures - a phenomenon tolerant. In comparison with other places, naturally.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_105">
		<text>Hunt for mutants. For the bodies of some of these merchants and scientists are paying good money. Do not believe me? Go see for yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_11">
		<text>You tell me this, Stalker: why do you loners sometimes go nuts? You lack some basic discipline? The other week, one guy decided to go past the Scorcher. And they say he was experienced, too... There's an easier way to get rid of your brains - put the barrel of your gun in your mouth and fire away!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_12">
		<text>Fuck these Mercs. They've been drinking our blood for a long time, and now they've turned on the eggheads too. And why did they give in? Because of some ransom? Or to share their Nobel prizes?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_13">
		<text>Lately the Mercs have become much more active. We also call them "Marauders." They're just another kind of swine here, don't know if you've heard of 'em. Kind of like bandits, except experts in the ways of war. Strange thing is, they used to prefer to attack Stalkers, but as of late they've been more interested in whacking scientists. But watch out in any case, 'cause I wouldn't put it past them to shoot your head off, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_14">
		<text>Heard a rumor that the eggheads dug up something awesome. And suddenly everybody went nuts. The troops and the Mercs and even the Duty guys weren't far behind 'em.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_15">
		<text>If you want to know about the same thing that everyone's been bugging me about for the last two days, then I'm telling you: go jump in an anomaly! If I knew, I'd tell. But I don't know - don't know shit! What did those scientists find? Where did our leadership go? Don't ask me! I don't have anything to do with any of it! They're off on vacation, and don't have to answer to us and explain themselves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_16">
		<text>Ha! Everybody's gone batshit around here! The Confederate and his boys have returned from a raid, and dragged a whole bunch of artefacts in. You should see the haul! Of course, Confederate is silent - he doesn't say a word, as usual - and all of his guys are joking around as if they went up to the Yukon and struck gold... The bastards!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_17">
		<text>During the last few days there are all these beasts coming in from the Scorcher. The people by the old warehouses constructed a barrier. For now, they seem to manage. If it weakens... Well, they'll have to go for reinforcements. There's nothing else to do...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_18">
		<text>Did you hear the rumors going around that the Zone is growing? I think it's true: I saw a frightening humanoid mutant right by the perimeter. Before you'd only run into things like that towards the center of the Zone. Things don't look good, do they?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_19">
		<text>It's very possible that they're not lying about the bloodsuckers by the border of the Zone. But what does that have to do with the widening of the Zone? Maybe a pack wandered off towards the border, maybe they got through one of our patrols. But we've got things under control. You don't hear about anybody screaming, "Help, we're being surrounded by mutants!" past the perimeter, do you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_2">
		<text>Yeah, it's kind of sad, after all. Just the other day Otter died, for absolutely nothing. Just can't believe it... You haven't ever heard about Otter, have you? Well, he was practically an expert - here from the very first year, he knew the Zone like the back of his hand. And then like that, out of the blue! There are some real experienced Stalkers out there, but the Zone still takes them. There are others who end up going back to the Big Land.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_20">
		<text>What do you think? Does the Barman know the details about what the scientists dug up? Listen, maybe he even hooked up with them. Seems like lately he finds more experienced Stalkers and gives them strange assignments. Doesn't explain anything, just says, "Go here" and "Go there." And the places are dangerous, with no goodies in sight. What the hell is he looking for there, anyhow?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_21">
		<text>Something strange is going on. The zombies that used to be afraid to go into the light are now trudging around all over the place. What the hell's that all about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_22">
		<text>The zombies became more aggressive and active for some reason. Before, we used to purge them right in the complex itself, but now we can only hold the entrances to the complex. But you didn't hear it from me, understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_23">
		<text>Be careful, 'cause these walking corpses have flooded the whole territory. Dumb as a rock, but aggressive. We're constantly under siege - day and night. It's quite dangerous here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_24">
		<text>Oooh, I bet the eggheads have really fucked up bad in that lab of theirs! Before, it wasn't very likely for a person to run into a zombie, but now they're just pouring out of the complex. What's weirdest, though, is that they're wandering around as if they lost something and are looking for it. Wonder why...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_25">
		<text>Rumors are going around that the scientists hired one of ours to go down to the lab. Gave him something... Some sort of protective gear... Nothing else, not even more details.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_26">
		<text>They blab all sorts of things. They even say that some nutcase turned up who talked with a scientist and agreed to go down to the lab for them for some reason. Now there's some nonsense!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_27">
		<text>And here's the big joke of the week: The eggheads gave one of your guys a pretty good grant, and so he climbed into the lab with one of their instruments. Another victim, damn it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_28">
		<text>I think something's brewing again. The eggheads dug something up that has everyone running around like chickens with their heads cut off... Which means that you and I won't have any peace, either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_29">
		<text>Who fucking knows. Just started hustling us around twice as much as before - either a blockade, or a purge... And there's a significant increase in troop numbers in the Zone as well.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_3">
		<text>It's all sad, that much I know. There's always been lots of people on the periphery, but half of them have never been deep into the Zone and there aren't enough artefacts for everyone. They even ripped out the equipment from the labratories and factories. Soon there won't be anything left to do here but open a restaurant... With an exotic view and glowing cuisine, of course.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_30">
		<text>I don't even know what to tell you... There's always something going on here, but within the bounds of reason. Although they don't think so in the Big Land, but you and I are, so to speak, in an anomalous zone now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_31">
		<text>The eggheads are sniffing something out. Who the hell knows what secret they've already stumbled upon, but they're certainly got the grunts wrapped around their little finger. And those guys are searching all over the Agroprom and the Dark Valley already, searching, searching, trying to find something...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_32">
		<text>With every day there's more and more crap coming out of the Scorcher, and the guys from Duty and Freedom are on the rag again. So they'll kill each other off, and then what? How long can we hold the border all by ourselves?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_33">
		<text>The mutants are trying harder and harder to get past the barrier. Lately it's been really hard. If some people would put an end to their stupidity, we would have more success!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_34">
		<text>Duty keeps on screaming about their super-heroic deeds on the barrier... If only someone believed them! We started this deal, and we're the ones that keep it going. And on top of that, many of the loners like yourself willingly stayed behind. But those guys from Duty... What a bunch of assholes. To hell with them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_35">
		<text>I heard that Duty has totally sold out. They keep on saying something like, "We're all volunteers who want to establish safety and order in the Zone." Yeah right, volunteers! Some sponsor gave these so-called "volunteers" so much ammo, such weapons, that you'd die from envy. They definitely sold out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_36">
		<text>What rumors are going around? I'll tell you without any rumors: soon there'll be more order. We'll purge the Zone of all sorts of beasts, and of certain other assholes, too...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_37">
		<text>Did you hear what the guys from Duty are saying they'll do to us? "Turn them to dust" - and that's just the bare minimum. This whole thing worries me... Especially since, people say, they've rearmed themselves with state-of-the-art equipment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_38">
		<text>What news? We sit here, the animals come at us, we run them off, then they come again, only stronger. Granted, a few times the military birds came by, and it seems they even flew past the Scorcher.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_39">
		<text>What news can there be? Same shit, different day. Mutants, Freedom... Although recently soldiers started flying by in helos. At least they could have shot up some beasts once. But nooo, none of that...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_4">
		<text>News? Who cares what they say! You can't believe everything everyone says. For example, they say that some experienced Stalker came from the inner areas, brought something nobody's ever seen before, impressed a ton of chicks... Well, I can make up a hundred stories like that myself!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_40">
		<text>I saw some military birds: imagine this, they flew overhead and headed past the Brain Scorcher! Well, I'm thinking, "They're gonna crash any second now." But nothing - they just keep on going. Hung out there for a while, twirled around, and then headed back. Typical, only in the sense that it is totally unlikely, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_41">
		<text>Now that there's a way to the center, there must be piles of treasure lying right under your feet!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_42">
		<text>Now that there are ways of getting to the center of the Zone relatively safely, Stalkers are drawn to it like flies to shit. Yeah... Greed really isn't humanity's greatest quality.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_43">
		<text>Now THIS is the life! While everyone from the Bar and the perimeter are still trying to get here, we'll get all the best stuff! We'll gather all the best goodies, and let the others pick up our scraps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_44">
		<text>Well, they say that it actually exists - the Granter of Wishes. Somebody even managed to get to it already, and wished for a whole ton more wishes...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_45">
		<text>Listen, buddy, I know that anything can happen in the Zone. Saw it myself. But these stories about the immediate granting of wishes, about a private resort in the Caribbean - it's complete bullshit and nothing else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_46">
		<text>Don't you know? Two of our guys - some of the very first who made it to the center - actually got to the Granter of Wishes and wished! Their whole life they dreamed about islands in a warm sea, so now they're prob'ly catching some rays somewhere in the tropics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_47">
		<text>We found a hero - the main guy from Freedom. Everyone thought that he went back to the Big Land, but actually he took a small team and somehow made it past the Scorcher. Now THAT's a real man!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_48">
		<text>One of the Freedom detachments was spotted in a formerly inaccessible part of the Zone. How did they manage to get through unharmed, much less survive a few weeks there? Can't even imagine. Guess we underestimated these guys...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_49">
		<text>Imagine this - they found our Mikluha! And the guys that were with him also survived. They snuck past the Brain Scorcher, and then spent a month just killing time. Couldn't get back out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_5">
		<text>There's something fishy brewing. Rumors are going around that the leader of the Duty faction, the head honcho, didn't just leave the Zone on business, but made a deal with the Freedom faction. Well, they could have made the same deal in the open, because now everything's a muddle. Things don't look good. On the other hand, the experienced guys say that they started fighting back in the day for no good reason in the first place. Just hope the government freaks from the Big Land don't drag us all into another meat grinder.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_50">
		<text>You heard? The troops will be here soon! They found out that the Scorcher broke down, and decided to take all the goods for themselves!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_51">
		<text>New info has just come in: there's going to be a massive-scale landing of Army troops at the station. My advice for you is this: if you want to snag at least a few of the goodies, hurry!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_52">
		<text>It's complete chaos, that's what it is! But you see, the corridor has opened, they purged the station of all kinds of shit - and there you have it. The military is ready to take advantage of it! No shame and no conscience. Typical.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_53">
		<text>I don't get one thing: How could the members of the Freedom faction hold out for a month here? Do they have invisibility cloaks or something? There's no fucking way!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_54">
		<text>Do you understand what's going on here? Well, I just gained new respect for Mikluha! Imagine - to survive four weeks in this shit, and to not lose any of your guys, either!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_55">
		<text>Some of them went crazy here. And to think, they all used to be pretty tough guys, but now are complete slack-jawed retards. Scary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_56">
		<text>The closer you get to the station, the stronger the unknown telepathic force becomes. Some have started going insane, others are traumatized and are seeing things. Maybe this is a good time to retreat a bit...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_57">
		<text>Listen, people here are really losing their minds. Somebody sees a stone and starts hollering that it's his damned artefact, that he saw it first, and that everyone else should go south. Another one sees Dja on a cloud embracing his buddies who disappeared years ago... No, there's definitely some sick shit going on here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_6">
		<text>The grunts are bustling about - searching, digging. Before, the helos used to fly only to Yantar - protected the scientists, carried supplies and technology. But now they're practically invading - planning all sorts of expeditions, driving around in APCs. Already saw them at the Agroprom and in Dark Valley. Don't understand it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_7">
		<text>They say that someone tried to get through the Scorcher again. Well, obviously he never came back... You never heard of the Brain Scorcher? What's wrong with you, man? It's the biggest danger in this whole area! Only problem is that all the horrors they say about it are mostly true.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_8">
		<text>Here, besides the bandits, the troops started roaming around for some reason. Before you'd see a helicopter once in a hundred years, but now they're practically flying around the whole Zone. Did they lose something, or what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_9">
		<text>I want to warn you, Stalker... The soldiers here lately seem to have lost it. Before, they used to calmly and quietly protect the scientists, but now it's as if their tail got burned or something: dashing around, bustling... Not in the most peaceful mood, either - shot at your boy more than once already, and even among us they've wounded two men in the last week alone.</text>

	<string id="dm_intro_112">
		<text>Well, who have we got here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_113">
		<text>And who is this we have here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_114">
		<text>Hey, man...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_120">
		<text>I did here recently. But already tired of my local obstanovochka. Get out harder than climbing</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_121">
		<text>Well dear man! Also hiding? Everything is hidden - who is from a past life, who by himself wants to escape.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_122">
		<text>You know about the clear sky clan? Conspiring with secret agents. Only fragments of radio transmissions are heard about them, and even other Stalkers tell different stories.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_123">
		<text>There appeared here recently a group called the Avengers. It is unclear what the clan targets. I've seen many people in my life, and learned to understand, but these men are natural killers. Professionals in one word.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_12">
		<text>If you have questions, then head straight for the Bar and don't bother me. They'll tell you all about it there, and answer your questions, and ask their own. But I'm tight on time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_13">
		<text>First time here? Then I suggest you go to the Bar: there your colleagues will tell you all the latest news.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_14">
		<text>Try not to get too close to zombies, and don't go to the lab, got it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_15">
		<text>I don't recommend you to get near the lab. Too many zombies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_16">
		<text>You know, I would suggest that you keep your distance from the laboratory complex.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_17">
		<text>Watch out for zombies - they're dumb, aren't afraid of anything. And better not go to the lab - they have their breeding grounds there, or something...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_18">
		<text>Keep in mind that the Brain Scorcher is close. Don't even think about heading north.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_19">
		<text>Watch out - if you don't want to lose your brains, don't go any further north from here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_2">
		<text>Be careful when you get past the bridge, got it? There are packs of wandering dogs there. If you don't pay attention, they'll tear your ass apart in no time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_20">
		<text>Look out for yourself! You know that the Scorcher is very close; if you go north, you'll be another dead dumbass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_21">
		<text>It's as if we're walking through a minefield, only worse. Who knows what goes on in here? Can't relax even for a second.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_22">
		<text>I suggest you heighten your attention, and once you heighten it, keep it alert and don't relax. The minute you relax, you're a goner - the Reaper will get you on the spot.</text>

	<string id="dm_intro_23">
		<text>Here you have to be on your toes all the time! Sleep with one eye open! Shit can happen to you any minute here.</text>

		<text>Be careful with the dickheads! They're like cockroaches here, tons of them!</text>

	<string id="dm_intro_25">
		<text>Destroy the so-called "Monolithians" as soon as you see them. They're very dangerous - real fanatics!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_26">
		<text>There are some retards here, they call themselves Monoliths... Or someone else started calling them that - well, don't matter. Basically, they're not afraid of pain. If they run out of rounds, they jump on you themselves and literally try to gnaw through your throat. So, if you see one, don't think twice about it and blow his ass away!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_3">
		<text>Listen up. If you see a tunnel, don't go in. I'm telling it to you straight, 'cause not everyone has the brains not to get themselves into shit. They won't even be able to carry you out afterwards - they'll have to scrape you off the walls. That's the Zone, understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_4">
		<text>Why's your pack so light? Did you also run into the freaks under the bridge? Those motherfuckers! They almost killed me just now. Had to give them almost all of my goods! And they're sitting around, patrolling. Bandits, these grunts at the checkpoints, makes no difference.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_5">
		<text>Why are you going all alone? There are lots of razorheads here, can catch you at any moment! Lately, I heard, they completely lost it - now they're even attacking the security checkpoints!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_6">
		<text>I'm warning you if you're not up-to-date: lately the bandits have been moving around in here. This is already the second shoot-out with them in just a week. Be careful and watch out - they've already sent six loners to the pearly gates.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_7">
		<text>Did you by any chance hear what the troops needed in the Research Institute wing? Why have they become so active?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_8">
		<text>You better be more careful here. The bad guys are hiding out in the main building. In a word, they are jackals - no conscience, no mercy... They would have killed everyone off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_intro_9">
		<text>You shouldn't go into the Dark Valley alone. There's a nice tight bandit nest there in one of the buildings - still can't smoke them out of there. Be careful not to run into them, man.</text>

		<text>Fuck those Monolith... They turned completely crazy, there was a time when they were quite peaceful... I remember once I've met one of them, he started telling their usual rubbish about the Monolith, he said something like 'Brothers, the Monolith has summoned me last night. I talked to Him. He was beatiful in His magnificence. His light has nearly blinded me, but it filled me with great power! I know, I feel that His power is among us! He told me that only strong faith can defeat the forces of evil. He also said that His power will be only with His true followers. He told me that our victory is close', I replied to that guy: 'Go away with your Monolith!'. He became very angry and shouted: 'The time will come when we will clean the Zone of all untrue!' and stuff like that. Looks like he wasn't telling lies then - the followers of Monolith are coming in crowds from CNPP, shooting everyone, fucking weirdos!</text>

		<text>Young Stalker, if you see a message about Semetsky's death on your PDA - don't worry about it, it's one of the Zone's legends. You will get that message many times. People say that Semetsky was one of those few who got to the Monolith. And what did he ask for? Immortality, of course. So now he wanders around the Zone, dying and coming back to life. Some Stalkers say that they've seen him, but they could be lying. The Zone is full of secrets and mysteries... You're not bored with my stories, right? Well, go with peace. May you have good loot.</text>

		<text>Okay, here's a joke. Three Stalkers had an argument about who is the coolest. They've decided that the person who could get the most people out of the bar is the coolest one. The first one grabbed a massive machinegun, got into the bar, shouted:\n - Everyone get out of here!!! - half of the people have disappeared, about ten Stalkers remained there and they've beaten that guy up. The next day the second Stalker has dressed up like a mutant and walked into the bar. Some people have escaped through the windows, others through the door, only a squad of Duty soldiers was left - well, they taught him how to behave. The next day the third Stalker just walked into the bar, coughed and said \n - Kgh-hrm-kgh, pfff! Shit, damn that syphilis!</text>

	<string id="dm_action_info_105">
		<text>Well, there is a story, although they say that this happened a long time ago, before I got here. So... Once, a foreigner has decided to become a Stalker, earn some money,I think he was a scientist... No one knows what he really needed here, but he spoke nearly no Russian at all... Actually, it's not even known how he got into the Zone and got to Barman. Looks like somoene has told him about that beforehand. So, he spoke no Russian, although he though he did... He started to annoy Barman in bad Russian... He spent several hours with him. Maybe he needed to get somewhere, or maybe find somebody, I don't know... So, Barman didn't understand anything and decided to send him to the Freedom territory and told him: 'go there and there, that area is controlled by the Freedom soldiers, they will tell you everything you need', for some reason it was believed that Freedom members were good at English. That foreigner has liked Barman's word 'control', they say it's the same in English, I don't know if it's true. And, when the guy got to the Freedom base he started to annoy everybody, repeating 'Control, Controlled, Controller', waving his hands towards the Duty base. They say that Freedomers got scared, woke up the whole camp - it was at nigh, so they kept watch till morning. Afterwards the guy got kicked out of Freedom territory, no one saw him in the Bar either. Looks like he didn't find what he was seeking in the Zone...</text>

		<text>Nowadays many people have turned into 'ashmen'. Before no one had looked in the big piles in Garbage - the radiation is so high it can boil your balls. But now, when it's harder to find artefacts, they get into protective suits, take some medicine and go searching. There are many different things in those piles, but generally not very good.</text>

		<text>The rookies are really annoying these days. They get into anomalies and die one after another... Can you believe it, five young Stalkers hqave died in last two days! And others don't learn anything from their example! Nothing. You know, Fly has taken three rookies into his squad - nad where are thy now? But he has found some really good artefacts lately. Maybe he shot them himself? No, probably not... he's honest... relatively. Anyway, I see you're a new Stalker as well, so keep your eyes wide open. Good luck.</text>

		<text>Have you heard of secret laboratories deep in the Zone...? People say they still function... Yes, yes... I can't understand how anyone could survive there... without food or energy... Here's an interesting question - maybe it's not people that work there? I had an interesting chat with some guy the other day... He didn't see those laboratories himself... No, he didn't, but his PDA has recieved some strange messages at Yantar. They were about one of those laboratories. One guy was telling the other, swearing, that he has met a person in a costume that looked like Stalkers' costume, but different... And that person was transparant, and told him to get out of there. "Don't disturb us, go away, we are working here". Well, the guy got really scared... of course! If I saw something like that... On the other hand, the Stalker that told me about that said that it happened somewhere close to the Radar... So it doesn't seem to be truth... But you know... Mutations could be different and weird, right? Maybe those are not people but some kind of phantoms made of pure energy. What do you think?</text>

The next day it's all the same! So the rats decided to call a Blind Dog for help. So, they're running. That Stalker comes out, stops the squad and asks: 'Are there any cool ones among you?'. The rats let the Blind Dog come out and it says. 'Well, I'm cool.' The Stalker goes away and a Controller comes out: 'So, the cool one should give me ten artefacts, all the rest need to give me one each and you can keep running!'</text>

		<text>Hey, mate, have you ever heard of the 'Interception'? People say those are army special forces! But have yous seen them at work!? They aren't like those morons in Cordon! Not only they go into very remote parts but also spend months in the Zone! And that's not even a joke! They've got several bases around the ZOne, many secret places and they get their supplies via a helicopter. Their commander is some guy called Gromov... I don't think that's his real surname - they call him either 'Major' or 'Grom'-'Thunder'. You don't believe me, do you? Pahomych once met the 'Interception'! His legs saved him that time, otherwise they would've killed him... 'Cause it's all secret! Everyone knows Pahomych! Those people aren't rubbish, they are a serious team. Hell knows what they need here, but they work fucking good! If I had a third of their attitude - no, just ten percent! - I'd already have a big house in Sochi... People say those guys have some device... which detects mutant two hundred metres away. Any creature! Of course, with that thing they can walk around the Zone as though it is a park... Oh, I've also heard of some people... No, not soldiers, one of our guys... Well, they got to the center of the Zone. Not only they did that - people say they can tame creatures! They never go out of the perimeter, to the Outer Land - and no one comes to them... well, except for those who are chosen to get to the Sarcophagus... They've got lots of artefacts! Duty members know about them... they, know, but keep quiet, bastards! And if you ask any of them they'd say 'That's not true'. Aren't they bitches!?</text>

		<text>I had a very unlucky incident happening to me - I've lost my rucksack with loot. Just like that! I thought I'd have a lot of money, but then this unlucky thing happened: at night a blind dog has jumped out of the bushes and started growling at me. I nearly wet myself, that's how scared I was, at first I even thought it was a pseudodog because normally you can hear when the blind ones approach, but pseudos are silent. And I dropped my rucksack and ran away! I thought that that thing will chase me but it grabbed the rucksack and went to other direction, bitch! Now I'm going for a new expedition. By the way, do you want to go with me? No? Fine then, see you later.</text>

Everyone goes - 'WOW'! The second one says:\n - 'And yesterday I saw an enormous creature in the Zone, wasted all my ammo on it, grenades didn't get it but finally I killed with a flamethrower'. Everybody goes - 'WOW'! The third one starts:\n- 'I've spotted a great mutant in the Zone...' Everyone: 'And'... the Stalker continued: 'And I spent a long time cleaning my trousers!'</text>

But it's hard to find him - he doesn't stick adverts up on trees... And he doesn't agree to work with everyone. Takes a lot of money, but if you found him and he agreed to help you be sure - he will take you wherever you need to get. That's who I want to talk to.

		<text>You know what? You shouldn't sleep in this part of the Zone... I'm lucky, I can't fall asleep anyway... but other people have nightmares so terrible they sometimes don't even wake up in the morning... 'cause they have a heart attack during their sleep... Some die, others become crazy... But there is a rumor that there is a solution to that. If you really want to sleep, find a bucket... or at least a big pan... But it has to be unbroken, without any holes... Put it on your head and sleep like a log... Hey, you can laugh but it will be me making fun of you in a couple of days when you go mad of tiredness. You think you're smart? Then tell me, why the hell do the soldiers wear those helmets? Yes, now you start to understand something! Before, about a year or two ago they didn't, but look at them nowadays! They've got really strange helmets - guys have found a body of a soldier with one on the other day, they told me. In that helmet there was something like a net inside, made of thin copper wire, connected to the inside of helmet. And no one knows what that thing's for and why it is there. But I tell you, this buzzing has something to do with that all. It's definitely not anomalies - there aren't many of those here, in other places there are lots more... I think they are finding their ways. Preparing everything. Remember my words, they want to get to the Sarcophagus. Soon there will be a big bang - nobody will like it. Remember my words... I just hope I won't be nearby when this all happens...</text>

		<text>Did I tell you about the Dark Stalker? Okay, there's a legend about this Dark Stalker in the Zone and nobody knows where he comes from and what's his business here. The legend says he wears a long black coat with a hood on so you can't see his face and nobody has ever seen him with a gun. To be frank only a couple of people have seen him and from far away only, and they say he have them terrible creeps, even mutants ran away from him. Who is he? Some people say he is a new mutant, others believe him to be a ghost and some people think he was just made up by drunk Stalkers. Hell knows... I wouldn't believe in him before I see him myself.</text>

		<text>Listen to this joke about a controller. An old controller teaches the young one: 'Do you see that soldier on the post? His belt is tightened, his uniform is new, shoes shiny - he's called 'Spirit'. You can take control of him even from here, but there is no use - he can't shoot properly, scared of everything, he's got no muscles. Now look at the guy standing next to him, smoking. His uniform is worn, his shoes aren't new - he's called 'Scoop'. He's hard to take control of, he shoots well, always alert and he's got a lot of meat, sinewy though. You can take him at night, if he falls asleep. Now do you see that guy sleeping under a bush, without a belt and barefeet? That's 'Oldman'. He's got much meat full of fat but it's hard to get to him, he doesn't sleep at night and can kill you without any weapon. You need to get him when he goes into the village for vodka or goes for some artefacts into the Zone. And it's the last one - do you see that soldier, with a tight belt, shiny shoes? No, don't you dare take him for 'Spirit'. I once got one of them and after that I spent two weeks cleaning my lair, hardly ran away from him - he's called 'Sirsergeantmajor'.</text>

		<text>I've been told a new joke in the bar. A Stalker comes to Sidorovich, and Sidorovich says:\n'Listen, Stalker. I recieved a costume with full radiation protection from a secret Institute in Kiev. But nobody has tested it yet. Put it on and go into the Zone, try it out. And if you survive I will give you a discount for it'... And the Stalker agreed. He went into the Zone and did not return for a day, then two days, then three... On the fourth day he returns, angry as a snork and throws the costume on Sidorovich's table!!! Sidorovich got surprised:\n 'What's wrong, Stalker? Does it not protect?\n-'It does!'\n-'Not completely?'\n-'Completely!!'\n-'So why are you so angry?'\n-'Everyone in the Zone drinks vodka to heal radiation in the morning - ONLY I WALK AROUND SOBER FOR THE FOURTH DAY LIKE A FOOL!!!'</text>

		<text>Do you want a joke? A 'Niva' goes on a motorway towards the Zone, about 120 kilometers per hour. The policeman at the post whistles, 'Niva' stops and a quad of 'Duty' soldiers gets out of it. They've beaten up the police guy, shoved his whistle up his arse and continued driving. The guy took his walkie-talkie\n-'Seven two-seven three!\n- Seven-two!\n- Senya! Some idiots are going in your direction and they don't respond to whistle! Try stopping them with a rod! Have you understood, seven-two...?</text>

		<text>Hey man, have heard you of Phantom? No? I'm gonna tell you about him then, you're not going to believe me. People say there was a Stalker, no one knew his real name so everyone called him Phantom. He was an experienced Stalker and had a good personality, understood people and people understood him, some people say he studied as a psychologist in university, but that's irrelevant. The important thing about him was that he could get anywhere in the Zone without being spotted by anyone, army posts and anomalies weren't obstacles for him. He went into the center of the Zone frequently but once hasn't returned, probably got killed by a blowout or something. Well, the legend is that he became something like a poltergeist, wanders around the Zone for about ten years already, searching for Stalkers, and if finds anyone - looks into his soul, and if one is a good person he will help him, point at a shelter or kill mutants around. But if he finds anyone full of sins, then that person will not live for long - Phantom will rip him apart. That's a good-night tale for you...</text>

		<text>Marked One, where did you get that gun from? Bought it from Sid, I believe? Yeah, he's got fine guns but they cost a lot.

I better find my self a gun at the Garbage - it will emmit radiation but is going to be free.</text>

		<text>Hey, Stalker, I've been told a funny thing recently. Listen to this. There is a fight between Duty and Freedom members. So, the Freedom commander stands up and shouts:\n-'Let's go, for Freedom!' - and everyone goes into attack. 'Duty' Stalkers are on the other side:\n-'That's it, we're in shit, run for your life'.\nBut an old experienced Duty soldier says:\n-'Wait, don't run -', gets out his gun: bang-bang-bang! 'Freedomers' lie down. After five minutes another 'freedomer' gets up:\n- 'For the Zone! Hurray!' - and they start an attack. 'Duty':\n-'Now we're definitely in shit! We need to run!'\nThe old 'Duty' soldier:\n- 'Just wait!' - takes out a Kalashnikov - bang-bang-bang - 'Freedomers' lie down again. Some time passes. The commander of Freedom stands up again':\n- 'For our brothers, for Freedom in the Zone, let's go!' - and the attack begins again. Young 'Duty' soldiers start panicking again. The old soldier repeats his actions. 'Freedomers' lie down once more. After five minutes the commander of Freedom stands up. His face is covered in mud, he's all dirty and he shouts:\n- 'Fucking hell, are you really asking for it!!?'\nOld 'Duty' soldier throws a cigarette away and says:\n- 'Now it's time to run!</text>

		<text>Have you heard of mercs? No? Then listen and keep this in your memory: they are killers, very serious and determined, they can get anyone, dead or alive. Have you heard of Sych's death recently? A direct shot in his heart, the body was burnt, no evidence left - trust me, it's their style. Those guys have no ethics behind their actions, they could kill a person as easily as they squish a bug, the only thing they respect is money. There are rumors that they have a base in the Dead City, but no one has ever returned from there - mercs don't like unwanted guests. And do you know how they train? They catch a bandit or a Stalker, take him to their place, give him a Kalashnikov with two rounds and let him go anywhere. If after twelve hours that guy is still alive, he can keep living. That's what their fun is, comrade. During the whole time only Misha Squint managed to survive a meeting with them and that's only because he spent ten years working in spetsnaz forces. So, Marked One, if you see people in blue costumes, run away as fast as you can from there, but if mercs have an order about you, you stan no chance - they will get you even from underground.</text>

		<text>I heard there is a group of people... They sometimes are called shamans and sometimes druids. They are believed not to bring any electronic devices into the Zone - closer to nature and everything... Well, they say that the Zone and electronics... that the Zone reacts to all those electromagnetic impulses... and it attracts mutants to you. If you believe them it turns out the Zone is a living organism. They say that you shouldn't bring any devices into the Zone - a clever person will find his way himslef. But they carry weapons with them, bitches... Don't want to use their 'teeth and claws'... On the other hand, not many of them die in the Zone. Not more than us, certainly... So, maybe they are right in their ideas... They mainly get in from Belarusian side, though... Otherwise it might've been a good idea to watch them. And to check how many artefacts they have in their pockets...</text>

		<text>Can I get a cigarette of you? You don't smoke? I see... That's good, you know. Helps your health and you'll have enough breath to run away from dogs, he-he... You know, some experienced mercs, bloody snipers, were killing Stalkers in a very interesting way. When Stalkers group together and smoke, a merc spots the light from the match and the cigarette. Then, when the second and the first Stalker lights up his cig, the spot of light moved and the sniper could see both of them. Finally, when the third one lights up his cigarette with the same match he immediately gets a bullet in his head... That's why Stalkers now have a rule 'Three people don't light up thei cigarettes with the same match.' So it's all fun and jokes, but one's life could depend on that...</text>

		<text>I remember a few nights ago while walking to a camp I came across someone, I recognized his gear to be that of the army's, and in one arm he cradled a spetsnaz rifle, he was acting weird, he didn't seem to notice me at first, he was dragging one foot and his movement was limp, he was gripping his rifle strongly though, so I kept my pistol pointed at him, he didn't seem to notice or care, in fact, he kept on walking by me, his eyes stared into me, and I knew something was wrong with him, as he past me, he attempted to say something it was mostly incoherent but I did make out "Controller... Help'. As soon as I tried to help him I heard a heli, got scared and ran away. I got into a little grove. Then about seven soldiers have appeared and then I saw the helicopter. Three people have aimed for that guy and the others ran at him and tackled him to the ground. Can you imagine, one of their own - face into mud! They were also shouting something about a helmet. Then they brought him into the helicopter... It's all very strange... That guy, his words about a controller... Soldiers... Did he manage to escape a controller...?</text>

		<text>Recently, me and four other cold Stalkers asked a lone Merc if we could join him by his fire. He turned out not that bad of a fellow, the merc explained to us that he killed only under orders, most Stalkers treat Mercenaries with respect, and they can relate rather well, Mercenaries show respect to Stalkers, but consider themselves unsurpassed masters. But this Merc described his lifes story to me, For his service he's in the "Order of Courage" and has a medal showing it. He learned in a center for training snipers, "In there, they take everything very seriously.", he told us. Everytime they fired a shot, they were to check their weapons, and fire again, and repeat the process. He told us, you can't really be a sniper til' you've had to be one in war, right at the muzzle. Sometimes one was taught really thoroughly for a long time but as soon as it got to exams (usuaaly they were in Chechnya) - no, the person just can't do it. You can prepare at school, shoot all targets but as soon as it all gets real something switches inside the brain and you stop. That's how it is. So, Marked One, be strong in the Zone.</text>
