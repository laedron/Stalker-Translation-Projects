		<text>You interested in selling it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lanky_suit_3">
		<text>Well, I can't sell it if it's not fully proven - but if you're happy to replace the expensive artefact I used, then I'd be happy to let you test it!</text>

		<text>You mean you don't know if it works? Shit, what artefact do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lanky_suit_5">
		<text>It's a very unusual one - a Mushroom artefact. Last time I heard of one was near a rare anti-gravity anomaly in Facility F1. A Stalker told me he'd seen one there but, as much as he tried, he couldn't get it out. He was really pissed about that... You might try some of the old Labs too, you never know...\nAnyway, get me one of those and the suit's yours, providing you bring back a full field report on it. I'll give you a form...</text>

	</string>
	<string id="lanky_suit2_2">
		<text>You must know how much a Mushroom artefact goes for, which makes this a hellishly expensive prototype! It'd better work!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lanky_suit2_3">
		<text>Hey, nobody's forcing you to do this. You can get around in that area through the underground passages...</text>
	</string>

		<text>Crap. I don't have that option...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lanky_suit2_5">
		<text>As you wish, but be warned - There's a maximum amount of time you can be in this kind of storm before the suit will start to weaken, so please make your excursion brief. Otherwise, we'll never know if it worked...</text>
