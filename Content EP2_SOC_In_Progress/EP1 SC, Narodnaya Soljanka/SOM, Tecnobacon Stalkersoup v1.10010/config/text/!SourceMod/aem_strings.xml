		<text>Here's the deal. This time you became the Arena champion, but that's a very tenuous title, and there's no guarantee we won't be scraping you off the floor next time. Tournaments are arranged pretty regularly, once or twice a day. Matches are usually from 22:00 to 06:00, but we sometimes start earlier or finish later. Some days we're closed. It depends on how many bums are on the seats, and how many contestants and mutants we've got in reserve.\nI'll notify you by SMS when they start, so keep an eye on your PDA. While you're still the champion, you'll have full access to all announced fights. You also get to decide in which order you'll fight, and what weapons you use.\nThere are strict rules about explosives and other shit, though. Grenades, RG-6's, RPG-7's, Gauss rifles, miniguns, and other such crap is banned, because the punters don't like it.\nThat's pretty much it. The Arena still needs to be hosed down, so why don't you go and have a drink in the Bar? Just don't miss the next fight - okay, champ?</text>	<!-- Two spelling errors fixed - Sword2012 - 26 Oct 16 -->

		<text>The first thing that comes to everyone's mind is "What the freaking hell are these guys doing in the Bar?" Well, thanks to their numerous connections, Duty can organise and allow this. There are few doubts as to the professionalism of these soldiers, who had years of experience behind them even before the Zone appeared. Some of these guys have done tours in Afghanistan, Georgia, and Chechnya. Then they've spent several more years policing and raiding the Zone, so they're still sharp. They also have the best weapons and body armor the Russian government can produce. But they don't get paid well, which is why they come here...</text>

		<text>The Mercenaries are a well-organized paramilitary group made up of freelance contractors. They're financed well, and carry imported guns. Rumor is that they work for foreign interests and governments, in addition to Russian, Ukrainian, and maybe even Georgian clients. I'd call them a side-effect of the Ukrainian government trying hard to join NATO. These guys are ruthless, and the locals try to keep as far away from them as possible - but to the Military, they're like a bone stuck in their throat. They give the Mercs the highest priority if they spot them, which kind of makes me respect the soldiers, because the Mercs' have some serious firepower, and they enjoy killing...</text>

		<text>Freedomers are the sworn arch-enemies of Duty. They have a lot of former Dutyers among their ranks, those who rejected the 'We are the last hope of humanity' ideology. That's one of the reasons relations between their factions are still tense, to put it mildly. Even though Duty considers Freedom to be nothing more than a gaggle of stoned anarchists, Freedom still put up a hard fight. Freedom is definitely better organized than that, and their guns and armor aren't too bad either. Duty had many of their best fighters cross over, so they're right to be wary of an enemy that knows their tactics. At the moment, there's a cease-fire between the two factions, but it's never far from erupting again...</text>

		<text>There's a small problem. Arnie got drunk and picked a fight with an anomaly. The anomaly won, and Arnie's now one with the Zone. Sorry guys, but there'll be no more fights in the Arena until we find a new manager. When we do, I'll let you all know...</text>

		<text>Dammit, that new Arena manager's gone walkabout. If any of you Stalkers can track the smell of alcohol, just bring him back here, will you? You'll get paid, but you'll be lucky to find him now. The Arena stays closed until we find the guy, or someone to replace him...</text>
