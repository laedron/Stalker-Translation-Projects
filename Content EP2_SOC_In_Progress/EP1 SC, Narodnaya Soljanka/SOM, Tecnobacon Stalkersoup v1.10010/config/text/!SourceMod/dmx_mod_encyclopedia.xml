It was completely destroyed during the Second World War only to be completely reconstructed in 1983. Many employees of the Agroprom Research Institute used to live there. In 2009, it became a haven for Mercenary Groups, but the Freedom Faction claims it to be their own as well, which has lead to constant conflict between the two in the past... Just recently, however they have come to an agreement, and were united into a single Clan with a single, solitary purpose: To keep all others out of the Dead City at all costs!!!...

Over the years it fell prey to scavengers and elements, slowly falling apart. The city's central feature is the town square, with a statue of Lenin in the middle. This square also houses the city's culture/sports centre and party headquarters. A short distance to the south-east lies the school, complete with a basketball court. The rest of the city is occupied by block housing, dilapitated single homes and garages.

They tend to avoid sources of light, therefore choosing to dwell only in dark, gloomy vaults and caves. In close combat, they tend to attack through the use of gravitational force - which repels their opponent(s) with such force as to cause serious physical damage both internally as well as externally. They are also capable of levitating heavy objects, and using them as weapons in the form of a flying projectile attack.

		<text>In Pripyat, under the library, there was a clandestine Laboratory that specialized in Animal Experimentation. Particularly on Gorrillas. There was an accident took place there even before the second Zone incident of 2006. From the official transcript taken from a tape recording of a statement from Special Forces operative Gustavo Marakina:... I heard the alarm signal, and went to investigate. Upon entering the main hall just outside the Research Library, I very nearly dropped my weapon and ran for my life... at least seven Scientific staff members lay on the floor there covered in blood, and completely torn to pieces!!! From further down the corridor I could hear heavy, plodding footsteps... coming closer... closer... then, as if in an instant it was there... it was just under two metres in height, round-shouldered, extremely hairy... reminded me of a giant ape or gorrilla. It howled a horrible, sad bellowing noise at me... and I turned for the main entrance, and ran as fast as I could... never looking back... I could feel it chasing after me... taunting me with it's cries. I made it to the Exit opened the coded security door... and just kept on running... never looking back!!! I know now, my mistake... of not closing the door... sealing the Exit behind me... locking this... this... "Thing" in there forever... but, I cannot change the past... and I must live with it for the rest of my natural life... "sobbing sound"...</text>

		<text>I am copying this data into your PDA so that you do not forget this very important piece of information. It goes like this: I wandered into some caves with an associate of mine known locally as 'the Labyrinth'. So, at the very deepest end of it, we were attacked by Rats. A lot of fucking Rats. Filthy, disease ridden creatures!!! We ran away as fast as we could until, eventually we fell into what appeared to be a large cavern. We climbed onto a ledge, and from there began to shoot back at the Rats... they just seemed to keep coming... more, and more of them... multiplying!! I had a strange Artefact on my belt known as a 'Simbion'... All of a sudden, my buddy grabs it, and jumps into the oncoming throng of Rats... unbelieveable!! At this point, some sort of anomaly began to form where he had landed... first, it was invisible... and then, a bright, white flash... then, I lost consciousness... When I came to... I could see the Artefact in front of me... surrounded by a pile of dead Rats... all of them dead!!! and lying in the pile was the skeleton of my dead Associate, Zhal... He was a good person. Not corrupt like most. I miss him dearly... and will never be able to repay his sacrifice on that day... As it turns out, the 'Simbion' artefact is the result of a transmutation involving 'Fruitpunch' anomaly. You must throw a raw 'Simbion' into it, and about ten minutes later... it produces a new Artefact known as 'Rattle'... because of its shape. There is nothing more I can tell you... take this information, and use it well... Good Luck.</text>
