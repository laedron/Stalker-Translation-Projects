	<text>29 June 198... (Year erased)\n \nToday we brought. As rumored, will be kept under the ground... Bastards! I'd rather have agreed to a death sentence... Although no one asked us - as played as the notes. And 'suddenly discovered' new circumstances, and a new article in the code of political prisoners. And when he began to bald heartfelt speech to the 'voluntary assistance to science' ... Bastards all of them! No one is no choice - or be shot here, I do not know where... Okay, let's see what's for science.\n \nJuly 12\n \nIt seems I was wrong! They gave not only food, but also some camera! True, for us day and night watching... But listen to any request to me, after I asked, instantly brought a pencil and paper, and Nikolsky - allowed to listen to recordings of some of his favorite rock band! Idiot he is, of course, heh, heh... If it were not for these records, it would not take over speculation... I wonder why he - a speculator, with us, the political prisoners sent?\n \nAugust 1\n \nafter almost two months, everything begins to clear. We are doomed... Those bastards put here experiments worse than the Nazi doctors in concentration camps. AS IN OUR COUNTRY IS POSSIBLE! ' Today, led after the 'experiments' St. Nicholas... He was dragged by my camera, and he raised his head, looked at me... Damn! These were the eyes of man! What they do to him? He did not look at me, no, through me, inside me! His mouth was bleeding... A spot on the floor in front of the camera...\n \nAugust 2\n \nI almost did not sleep all night... Shouting from the wall, they do not look like human... I asked the guards to drink, incredible, but they brought me vodka in plastic cups, as in aircraft. The security guard asked not to tell anyone... He himself seemed unimportant. The memory for you, Nicholas. May your soul rest until the body is still screaming in the next cell...\n \nAugust 24\n \nThat's all. Now it's my turn. Today I was explained my experiment. What is a 'generator' will irradiate me as long as they do not notice the changes. In response to my question, but what if I die before the changes, they replied that it was 'minor interference experiment. I raced one of them wanted to take the keys from the exit... What a headache... The security guard, the one that brought me vodka, gave bandage - wet wound after baton. Bint he took, so that no one saw him with me. But he is still a good guy. His name is Vladimir.
                 \nSeptember 10\n \nwrite all the harder. My fingers do not bend... They seemed to have become stronger - I broke the bowl with food three days ago. And it seems to bite aluminum spoon - do not remember... Tomorrow will again emitter psi - so this thing in the main hall is called... I was left alone. Nikolsky's lucky - he was just two days before his death, screaming. Most of my comrades muchilos longer... I am the last... They say - I do not so, I am particularly...\n \nSeptember 13\n \nnot a man anymore. Better, stronger. I am big. Rat. They gave it to me. I do not like a rat. Rats. I do not like. She wanted to bite. I would not. He forced her to run on the ceiling and walls. No hand made. I thought her head to run, and she ran to where I wanted. And then I stopped thinking, and she fell onto the floor from the ceiling. I went and thought she did not move. And stepped on it. I do not like rats. Dirty. They stood and watched. Luggage small. I'm big.\n \nOctober 1\n \nRat. They give me a lot of rats. I have them all made to run and fall. And a dog. She, too, like a rat. I think for her, and see what she sees. I do not like rats. The dog loves. I thought the dog's head to eat rats. The rats thought not to move. And the dog ate. Tasty... Too bad I did not dog. I am big.\n \nOctober 13\n \nThey did not know about me. They say that the learned. They are stupid. I was in their minds. I have seen. They could not see me. Volodya... One of them. He is weaker. He pities. It was good to me. I'll take him first. And think for him to open the camera. And then I thought that he killed the second, which was silent. He's strong, his head is difficult to think. Remaining weak. Not as Volodya, but weak. Those that were recorded and studied - is weaker. They are principal. But the weak. I'll take them all. They are like rats and a dog.\n \nOctober 20\n \nIn the woods better. There's mushrooms. I remember once eating mushrooms. And they, too, remember. But do not say. They were mooing and crying. Volodya no. It is not a rat. He better. I was hungry. Yummy... They think that I'm big. Right. Indeed. I am big</text>

	<text>January 29\n \nToday the postman brought the envelope. He could see the print from the Kiev Institute of Neurosurgery. Print, I saw the answer to my inquiry, I quote: \nDear Anton A... We have reviewed your thesis, as well as a number of your articles about the development of science in the field of neurosurgery, as well as your article 'about the impact of psy-radiation on the organism and the possibility of man.' We hasten to inform you that in one of our laboratories performed a set of new skills, and we look forward to seeing you in the main building of our record... can not read...\n \nFebruary 16\n \nThis is us and brought Laboratory. Surprisingly, I do not remember how we were going. I seem to get enough sleep before the journey, but when we boarded the bus and he drove from the Institute, I began to sleep and just fell asleep. The last thing I remember is how my companion, I think Michael, talked about his speech in Berlin at the conference. I wonder how we were going on time? Hour? Two? Inside the lab has not yet met hours. I completely lost track of time. Day or night? We traveled at 6 am. I think we could not go far from the NII, it is probably somewhere on the outskirts of Kiev. Maybe in one of the neighboring towns. Soon our group will be instructed, and we can see the entire lab.\n \nFebruary 17\n \nYesterday in the audience were briefed on safety. How did this tiring... feel like a student in practice. That did not take it, it does not touch. Does anyone of us still are not remembered? Just announced the collection of all newcomers in the audience, most likely, will show slides and a tour.\n \nFebruary 18\n \nTour impressed! Lab simply huge! The most modern equipment, apparently, articles about the psi-emission of many of our scientists still someone interesting. But something in the laboratory alerted. Despite the fact that all laboratories should always be clean, everything seemed too licked. It seems that prior to our arrival here brought cleaners Hotel Metropole, and they, as always, all cleaned up to the smallest hairs...
                        \n \nFebruary 23\n \nI thought, this day we will release a breath of fresh air and discover the country, but no such luck. How I managed to find out, we guarded platoon of soldiers. Although I do not understand why we do protect. From whom? thought that even in such a holiday, close to each soldier they would agree to release us for a couple of minutes started, but they were impartial.\n \nMarch 4\n \nToday is my first birthday, which I will not celebrate in a familiar home environment, and among his new family. Colleagues in the morning congratulated the holiday. While gifts and donations, but it is understandable how they buy them, being in complete isolation from the outside world?\nis not clear yet what will be included in my responsibilities. I learned from our senior researcher Gubareva Vitaly Semenovich, which must soon bring people who volunteered to serve science.\n \nMarch 10\n \nbrought the first volunteers. Crap, this is normal prisoners. They are volunteers and hard to call. What the volunteer will lead us in shackles?\n \nApril 16\n \nIt has been a month after they started work with 'volunteers' . The aim of our department in the preparation of equipment. After we brought these prisoners had been denied access to much of the laboratory rooms. We do not interfere with the prisoners. Thanks at least for that provides all necessary.\n \nApril 19\n \nLord, where am I? Cursed be the day when I was attracted by the opportunity for career growth here has agreed to go. Today something happened in the lab. We were locked on the floor and put two soldiers with machine guns, allegedly to protect us. We have not heard anything and we are even more frightening. We tried, as always do its job pretending that nothing happened, but all in vain. We knew that down there, something is happening. I wish I did not know the truth! Even in the high secrecy rumors spread fast. One of the experimental (Calling them more volunteers, I can not! Who I am lying? Himself?) became uncontrollable and either held hostage, or has control of several of our employees. As it turned out we protect not just a platoon of soldiers, as well... a leaf torn out...
                        \n \nMay 16\n \nIt seems that all my letters and asked to release me from his position no one reads or does not leave the laboratory. I can not stay here no longer work. I am more and more thoughts of sabotage or subversion. I'm ready for any action, just to quickly get out of here. I was never afraid of closed spaces, but I feel that such a phobia in me is growing every day. When I was in the works written about the psi-emission, I meant something quite different effects, which are obtained by extra-radiation doses of individual sections of the brain, and these same butchers irradiate the entire brain of such radiation, which is unable to sustain any of the normal people. I heard that whoever controlled the two scientists, was the second mutant. Total second. First he died after about 3 minutes after the start of mutational changes in the brain. His head just split like a walnut. Do not they realize what they are doing. For these prisoners, they were also the same people... and that if they soon start to miss those poor fellows? Whom they bring here? Homeless? What next? No need at all costs get out of here and tell the truth all over the world!\n \nMay 21\n \nCrap, I'm going crazy! It seems to me that someone is sitting in my head! I do not understand. Sometimes there are sharp bouts of headache, then they change to the noise in my head. Sometimes I think I hear a peep! It lasts only a couple of seconds and then begins a new headache! Are they completely mad? Do they have begun to suffer from their own employees, this radiation? What doses do they use? I've never heard of such effects from the radiation!\n \nMay 27\n \nAfter the next CP we were locked on the floor. It is now 4:00 and still no news. At this time the soldiers we have left, thank God. Since the last mordovoroty looked at us as potential enemies. The feeling that they are something something back...\n \nMay 29\n \nShit! Damn! Damn! For two days we were held captive. I hear that someone out there wandering, but all our cries no one answers. We will soon run out of food stocks. But yesterday we had fresh food to give to each floor. Some of my colleagues started panicking, we try to reassure them, but we will do it all the worse. And now, we happen almost every time when we begin to call for help (they have that reflex, we produce it?).\n \nMay 30\n \nis finished eating, there are not more than 2 liters of water... the farthest room, we decided to toilets, publishes a stink on the whole floor that he can no longer breathe... We tried to dislodge the iron door. They broke a massive table, but have not opened the door... behind the door, nobody goes, and this even worse. We do not know when will be cut off, it scares all the more...
                        \n \nMay 31\n \nBirthday of one of our colleagues. When we went to congratulate him, he hung a noose. They tried to save, but he hung a long time and all our attempts to fight for his life were in vain. After a while missed Mikhailova, who went to the toilet. When entered into the study, he was lying on the floor. Most likely, a heart attack. Both colleagues laid down in the same office.\n \nDate Unknown \n \nIn the laboratory, turn off the lights and dial, which shows the date and time, no longer lit. I am writing to the touch. Thought in my head anymore. We understand that everything here is doomed and no one will find us. I finally guessed the reason for such purity during the tour, and why the laboratory was so much vacant seats. All this is not the creation of a new wing in the laboratory and not in the fact that this is a young project. The thing is that we were originally suicide. The same as the previous group of scientists. They also failed experiment and all were killed. Survived only by those who led the experiment. Those who always leave tidy any situation... My grandfather called the staffs of these rats! And he was damn right. Here are all of us here... Rats experimental rats... people who voluntarily consented to sacrifice himself Science...</text>

	<text>'Letters forbidden to send or those that were returned back to'\n \nPrivate Petrenko \n \nDear Mama! I am writing to you after 2 months of service! I'm not a bit sorry that he had signed a contract for service in the Zone of Alienation. Our company is located in the local Institute entitled Agroprom. During the service I have managed to get into costume, and yesterday he entered on night duty. Service is dust-free, no hazing, as lieutenant Khadzhinov maintains iron discipline. As for radiation do not worry, in 86-meter, this Institute has been completely deactivated and cleared of radioactive particles. Background on the territory does not exceed the norm, but outside the Institute, he is 200-300 micro Rad/hour. Petka was told that as soon as the contract is over, I told him sure some souvenir will bring. There are such things interesting artifacts called. There are those that are radioactive, and there are those who, despite being on the infected area, on the contrary protect against radiation. Some of our guys even tried to prepare themselves such artifacts. To do this, I had some ingredients to throw in a special place, an anomaly, and after a while the whole mess becomes a superdense, tight connection with special qualities. Ends my leaf, I do not know what else to write. Do not worry about me Mama! Another 10 months and I'll be back! I promise to write to you again in 2 months. Most can not. Incidentally, this is the second letter that I send, and you say something in response. Your Sasha.\n \nReason: unintentional attempt disclosure of military secrets, the promotion zone.
                        \n \nSergeant Tihonyuk \n \nHi, Kostik! Strange that you got my letter so late. Probably somewhere lost in the mail and it could not find. I am very glad that you liked the photos, which I sent along with a letter. The last time I actually forgot to specify who is standing beside me. If you look from left to right, first is Peter Brovun, then comes Sasha Petrenko (he recently at us, only 3 months), I'm right, as you already guessed, and in front of us sits Vitaly Dmitriev. He was brought to the hospital yesterday. He was Lieutenant Zubko and Nechayev committing night skirting around our Institute. And how on earth it could happen, fell upon them bloodsucker marsh. A mutant was smart, judging by the stories Vitalik. At night, sniffing the bushes, grabbed Nechaev and sniffing back into the bushes. Through time again jumped out of the bushes and grabbed Zubko. And Vitaly Dmitriev, though not of the timid, but it just never saw that on his eyes from a living man craning his soul. Well, he was frightened. Rushed back, even a helmet on the way lost. But the leech still gets up near the gate caught. Oh, if it were not Anton Sedykh, I do not know what would have been Vitalkoy. But our sniper in the tower and protein in the eye and gets bloodsucker, but even the most tushkanu in his button, still not promazhet. Well, I do not know really how well he has turned out, but I beg bloodsucking, even without touching a comrade! That such is the history. In the shirt was born, nothing else! Tomorrow we are sending to patrol the area near the cordon, there Stalkers very insolent, to Barb holes done, and run hither, both on the highway. Waiting for an answer, my friend! 'm sorry that this news story, but not in our area of politics or economics. So we have to write here such here, almost criminal news. Vitek \n \nPS I still can not pass the feeling that before sending our letters someone reads. Perhaps this is the reason that not all letters have come to you.\n \nReason: unintentional attempt to disclosure of military secrets, an attempt to disclose confidential information to third parties.
                        \n \nPrivate Nikodimov \n \nHi, brother! I received your letter and immediately decided to write you an answer as there is free time. My affairs properly, serve as all. That's only the health of recently started to play tricks. It has become very prone to viral infections every one that is the same flu in the winter just did not give the rest. Doctors say this from the fact that irradiation near the anomaly during the last patrol. But I do not believe them. These stalkers to spend several hours near the anomalies, when boiled artifacts, even sleeping next to them are not afraid, but I was only an hour near the Vortex. I think the thing is that I am still in the late autumn injected... Scientists came to some, we have them here together egg heads call (suit them funny). So these chosen few slay a man for unknown principle, among whom was myself, and had a so called vaccination. After that, each day we were driving to the doctor and check to ask our well-being, even fed better than others. Recently two of our group vaccinated with a bigheads taken away. Until now, I do not understand why? But those were frequent headaches and pain in the back. Maybe they were taken to treat? But, strangely, seemed to be in the hospital's Research Institute is equipped with the most modern in the entire area. Perhaps keep back something. But I just do not give up, I have a strong body, I do not get sick as they are! I promise brother! My regards to all our relatives. I left a little longer, another 3 months and my contract ends.\n \nReason: a deliberate attempt to disclose top-secret experiment and communication of third parties.
                        \n \nPrivate Tsybenko \n \nHello Mom! I am writing to you immediately on return to the job. I worked there for only one month, but I'm already terribly sorry about the decision. Mama, I killed a man today for the first time. Although the people who roam here from time to time a little reminiscent of those people that I'm used to seeing in our village. Rather, they resemble the soulless machines that are willing to kill for any luminous object... They are like magpies, collecting everything that glitters and bad lies. They are ready to tear each other for a small glowing stone, a bottle of vodka, a bunch of grenades even sneakers. This is not the people. They are worse than wolves, which my father and I hunted. But this stalker. It was much more humane than in all of our guys together. He was wounded in the side of the cordon, dragging a gun. At first we thought it missed, our lieutenant ordered him to throw weapons, muttering to himself that he still had not long and it is he does not need. But he suddenly looked at us with a look of pain that tore him inside... he asked to save it, get rid of these miseries. Vic Tihonyuk told me that, it seems to mutate from the inside, it breaks the excruciating pain and that he would be better if we did not miss it. He heard the words like a sergeant and tried to pick up machine, sending in our direction. The lieutenant gave the order to shoot to kill and I, like other men clung to the sight rifle and pulled the trigger. I do not know why I was fired. Around me, and without enough shooters. In seconds, we made out just living man bloody mess. Several of our guys newcomers have asked the lieutenant approach stalker, but the mere thought he would look closely, I vomited. The Lieutenant just smiled and said that all normal people for the first time such a reaction and so brave, who wanted to look more closely, he replied that they still have time for their service and see a lot pohlesche. And then I wanted to throw everything to hell and back to our village. I am madly missed your patties for fresh milk from cows in the morning. But the money that I receive while serving in the Zone, you know, as we need them. The money you will make the operation, we have time, we will have time to cure your sickness before it starts to progress. Kiss Mom! And do not worry about me! I'm strong, I'll come!\n \nReason: Tsybenko Valentina A. no longer lives at pp. Polyans'ke d.35</text>

	<text>first day.\n \nNow I first go into the Zone, in a raid! Locals say the raid - this is such a sortie for something valuable. The man who gave me the order, explained that in order to learn how to survive here, a little raid. But this - check. The Stone Flower... I wonder what that is? He showed the fuzzy picture, I do not understand what on it. Some lines, flashes... Lights of different colors. But he told me that when I find this thing, then like no confusion. The Stone Flower... Blin, Danila-master feel! Okay. Money he had promised not bad, and still says - premium rate. This guy seems to be a local authority - or where he got so many things in the bunker?\n \nsecond day.\n \nI'm alive. This is important - and a couple of hours ago and could not survive. I do not believe that came out... Some sort of creature, there in the hollow, size, probably from the tank and rushed at me from the darkness. How I managed to get his gun over his shoulder?? Here it is, army training... And I thought two years have passed in vain. I'll be back - put the biggest candle for the health of elders Krivtsov. Although the church there is probably no close... Okay, I'll drink to his good health - learn how to shoot, infection... A gun I now hang over the shoulders will not. With the barrel in his hands calmly, though a bit inconvenient.\n \nThird Day.\n \nI found it! Everything was as he said, in a bunker! He... Flower He is wonderful, I have never seen such a beauty! I have long held it in his hands, and he beamed... Here they are - artifacts. Even sorry for him to give - after all it was my first success. Okay, time ago.\n \nthe sixth day.\n \nKhrenova case. Cartridges almost no, but I got lost. Places like the familiar, I remember yonder hill, these three trees near the well... But something has changed, though... I don't know. And on the way back to me attacking different creatures. Most are small, but slippery - all rounds of grapeshot wasted. Was left shot, five. If someone bigger dog attack - Khan.\n \nsixth day, evening.\n \nAnother huge creature attacked me! She was waiting for me in ambush! Like that night, when I first came here! Never forget that grinning face and fangs... Strangely, as if this creature is like a wild boar. Just awesome, and a lot of canines, I have not had time to count. And maybe, with fear of? I don't know. She rushed at me so fast and I like froze, paralyzed me! I just watched as she flew at me, and suddenly... Like encountered an invisible barrier - thing was thrown into the air, and then unwound, and then... God, I'm able to be in her place! So, the talk in camp about the true anomaly. Damn, where did I hit?!\n \nSeventh Day.\n \nIn the morning it seemed that I saw a man. Probably a hallucination - can not be here unarmed man in jeans... Yes, and his head was very big. I guess it from the Stone Flower - red hands, neck, back itches terribly. Maybe he radioactive? In the eyes of all the floats... And the sound in my ears like the voice... I must have been poisoned... Reach would be possible. Where am I?\n \nSeventh Day. Evening.\n \nhard to say... This person... He follows me all the time he was... And once I saw his face. So close, but he was far away. How can this be? Noises in my ears... This, he said, it had a voice - like the wind... And the whistle... No, he is not a man, he... Another... He knows where I hid... We just do not listen...\n \nRecord last. (Noise, crack)\n \n...Let...( noise )... I have to go home...Dark...Very dark...Great, let go...Or die...It's better...He...Do not give away...The gun has bullets... only one would happen... let... no... do not... do not bother me... all...( sound of the shot.

	<text>Report ? 25-19-12U.\n \nI did it! I'm going there in the Zone! All laboratory congratulate me today, even senior researcher Kovalev. Despite the fact that he does not like me, walked over, shook his hand and said: Congratulations, Comrade Pankov!' True, he smiled insincerely - it was superfluous. But still - I'm happy! I myself see the place where we deliver most of the facilities for research. Maybe even the scientific work completed in this year!\n \nIn the place was not at all what I expected. Scientific instruments for the most part quite unknown to me. Semyonov - the assistant chief of laboratory and part-time chief of the ML-4 (mobile camp) - said that they were 'local production' , and they contain some local artifacts. This is amazing! How far science has stepped here, inside the Zone!\n \nToday was a tough day. We barely managed to escape from the unexpected including facilities. Semenov made measurements of the radiation intensity, and I'm on the radio reported the results Kruglov (this is another senior researcher, it seemed to me - a bit opinionated people...), when he went of scale sensor. We barely with their lives. The earth shook as if under the building of the plant was awakened volcano! What kind of plant is capable of this? What is power! ' Semenov said that if I want to understand what is going on here, one must climb higher and look at the factory in the binoculars. I wonder why? Or is he joking?
                        \n \nI was the first time very scary. I followed the advice of Semenov... I climbed a tall tree, taking the binoculars. And look at what was happening at the plant in the courtyard... Lord, yes there are people! They go in circles like a lunatic! Some clothing scholars seem several injured... What's wrong with them? Why can not they quit? I have to figure out how to help them. Today Semenov and Kruglov had gone off, saying that it was not for long. Too bad, then I'll go alone. We must take more kits for the wounded scientists there, inside. And probably weapons. However, I shot only a dash from an air rifle. Anyway, let it be on the safe side.\n \nI am in an ambush near the plant on the roof of a shop. Incredibly, people are subject to some kind of monster, two-legged and upright! This parody of a man is jeans! Writing is difficult - probably psy-radiation affects coordination. Well, that installation does not work now - I checked. STOP. What if psy-rays? WHAT HAPPENS? Is that a monster can generate psy-wave? That's good that he did not see me... It is necessary to shoot at him... The main thing - to get into his head, if miss - I'm dead. Zombie (unfortunately, the only way can be called stalkers around the monster and scientists... What a horror...) where to shoot, he tells, and if I do not kill him right away - I simply riddled. But I must try. It is my duty, for them, those unhappy with him...\n \nTom who will find and read...\n \nI am wounded. Move can not - a bullet in the spine... Through the pain I can still write, but it is possible that soon lose consciousness - if I'm lucky... Alas, I'm no good shooter - full clip shot past. I hear the monster is drawn to me here. I have a little time. I do not want him alive, because it hurt - I saw how he ate a zombie when he got his foot in the door and broke it... If only once... I'm afraid. Goodbye. I did everything I could for these people.\n \nJunior Researcher Pankov</text>

He spoke about the factory Yantar, about the camp of tadpoles in the lake, about how many attendants they poured for the most unsold Stone Flower, and only for modifiers almost ready shirt with a steal. Well done - the fanatics... science. However, there is one drawback - to set the psi-emission. I myself have never seen a zombie, but the stories of experienced - not a pleasant sight. That Bald said that somehow skoreshilsya one stalker, so that he could share the booty, and, and back cover in battle, and a bar to drink vodka, and a week ago saw him on the road with Yantar (who seemed to be alone in raid left). He said that he was a hat, straight, almost on the edge of the anomalies, under his breath mutters something, but automatic drags on the ground. Bald, it was hailed as the voice drugan cut his queue until the horn is not empty. Well, bald, and realized that it drugan cooked their brains at Yantar and zombyaka become. In short, he had to bosom pals with his own hands and do away...\nsad... The truth of the counting of money, remaining after resupply ammunition, health kits and havchika becomes even sadder. It was not, but tomorrow the Dvina River in the direction of Yantar.\n \n
                      The bartender said that there is a road across the railway at Yantar patrol or whatever it's called... True and anomalies there nemeryano - should be bolts and nuts to get more.\n \nHere are lucky! He passed the bridge, that on the way to Yantar, without meeting a single mercenary. The truth had to lay nehily hook, because the vans near the platform bloodsucker ransacked. Well I spotted it in time. And when the bridge went under as much jaw anymore - throughout the passage of air streams, as from red-hot iron roof on a summer day. So many hot in, I had never seen! Almost an hour making his way, a pile of bolts wasted anomalies proveshivaya. But the artifacts bummed - 3 fireball and 5 some pear-shaped squiggle. Now a smoke, sit in the shade, the way... Pancakes! Who brought it ??...\n \nHere's what he - Yantar... Husky shop on the hill, a swamp with a black spinner, tank scholars, which I located - and silence. A bald man is not deceived - the chief scientist, Sakharov Seems like I saw my swag - much as his eyes lit up. I took all the arts and Salvage poured nemeryano, I'm still not a single raid so not raise! True to the bunker not let them quarantine, radiation - but oh well, on the roof where the helipad, too, can breath.\nOnly scary here. Quiet, only snorks roam the bushes, and zombies... I first met this on the way to Yantar, when I made a halt at the road. In the black kombeze dolgovtsa, left side burned, as if in a fire or fell into the hot flew, hobbling gait, because one foot is dislocated or broken. I wanted to wait when it will pass, and this bastard somehow sensed where I zatiharilsya and shmalnula PE-EMA. I had to soak, but until I told him Bosko has not carried a shotgun, he still tried to get up - a lot, you rat. Terrible sight.\n \nIt's time to move back to the bar. 'll Get on there than the thread-standing, can the 'Abakan' enough, and kombez change does not interfere. Bald meeting - affixed to a tip about scientists thanks to him.\nTaak... There's someone with gorochki down, Wait a look, that for the...\n \n(a loud low-frequency hum)\n \n... MMAT! WHAT ??!\n \nStep. Step. Road.\nNext. Forward.\nHube... Hub... swag...\nBar.

	<text>Diary dolgovtsa VLADIMIR flew \n \n27April\nI have taken a loan! That is, no, not so. And so - in debt! Now I must prove that it is not for nothing official rations. Still, I was here is no big calling. I, as they say, himself came. I was given a real, brand-new 'Abakan' with telescopic sight and grenade launcher, and another suit, painted in the colors of our group. Long could not stop looking at myself in the mirror at the bar. Then there was a drill, dinner, drill, dinner... The commander caught serious. Even the name he had such a terrible - loud. Dmitry Petrovich loud. Well, he drove us... in the evening I began to feel that I hate him. Although, okay. He's not with us so evil rides. Still, I myself came here. Oh, okay, speaker blowing collection of... then Finish, as will be possible.\n \nMay 1, \nWe stand on guard at the exit from the wild areas. I do umyknul minute - pochirkayu bit. Pooh, curves and Sanya look askance at me and joke. Like, nerd. Themselves are, see how you are. Let me tell you about their friends. Of the four of us formed edakii 'detachment' . 'Quad' - in dolgovski.\nPooh - is a round bumbling fool who tries to pose as an intellectual. Although Silushka him not to take - only a horseshoe bend. Commander solemnly handed him the PKK official and four tape cartridge. He now portrays himself from Rimbaud - tied the bullets, machine gun slung over his shoulder and looking menacingly into the distance, swung round spectacles on his nose.\nthe curve - or worse. Tall, skinny alcoholic with a constantly red-eyed, melancholy eyes and unceasing allergies. All the time, sneezing, itching, and said his nose, because of what looks like an interpreter Valadarski. He's a sniper. Loud (which Dmitri Petrovich) said that it hurt well he shoots and no less solemn than Pooh, handed him a tattered SVD.\nWell, Sanya - a single story. Sanya - this is not addressed, and the same moniker yak and all of us. Outwardly you look - not at all remarkable stalker. Age - 30-35 years. But. He is one experienced all of us together. So loud without thinking twice appointed him as our commander and gave him 'Enfield' with a silencer and podstvolnikom. More Sanya suit different from ours - he has a helmet with a visor of tinted glass, which completely hides the face. Croot and-a thing. At least, menacing looks.\nNow we are sort of inseparable team. So, I scream our - probably something espied - go and see.
                        \n \n2 May\nFuck, do not understand how he's still alive. For us yesterday with the wild territory of a sack - horror. Some sort of creature was broken nafig gate and rushed at us. Some major mutant, like wild boar, but only with two heads and a faster and more powerful. Pooh immediately opened fire with his machine gun, managed to shoot down creature on the fly, and Sanya has finished tvaryugu from his pistol (he had, by the way, 'Desert Eagle' - a terrible thing). He said that such a mutant, called 'Chimera' ... ugh... We've been thinking all. But it's no such luck. After about fifteen minutes from the break on us fell upon such a pack of blind dogs, half with psedosobakami what I ever saw. Special 60. Pukhov gun again, was very much into the subject, he could not even aim. Crooked deftly throw a grenade - only scattered clumps of enemies. Sanya were shot mostly pseudodog. Well, I just had fired into a crowd of monsters. So much blood and corpses, I've never seen. It is good that a couple of minutes just the right, three more quad for help. We rescued this wave. Phew... The entire blog is now in krovische monsters. Sprayed, you know.\n \n6 May \nYes, long time since I did not take in hand treasured notebook. And all of a sudden stroke of luck - Colonel gathered quads for the raid on Yantar - clean from zombies. Environmentalists sent a message that, say, a zombie afterwards came - brick has nowhere to fall. Well, we agreed. Zadolbalo drill and guard duty - the job done right! Clean the area from the mutants! Ugh!\n \n7 May \nWe collected our things - set off. Again, wild territory. Not feel there to stomp, but what to do - need. We walked up the aisle with the territory of Duty. On the wall of a huge banner, which they say does not go there - 'parvut. In pieces. But, as they say - should be.
                        \n \n8 May\n \nWe have reached. It was a complete ATAS... Not counting the bloodsucking and Bandos. Especially spoil the life of mercenaries - Merck, refers to them as Sanya and dogs. Both were attacked several times, but we somehow strayed and even survived an ambush in some abandoned house. But Geiger counter there is cracked, without ceasing, and we were soon forced to retreat outside. While Sanya talked to Sakharov, we climbed on the tank - look around. Awful place, oppressive. Crooked got his gunshot apparatus, lay on the roof and began to methodically shoot zombies. Predominantly - unarmed. Sly, cattle, heh. After a half hour left Sanya and said that we if we shoot zombies on the coast and around the bunker, then get five mowers on a helmet. If we reach the x-16 and postrelyaem them there, then the price has risen three-fold. On the helmet. Scientists themselves for two weeks leave the bunker, leaving only one officer. He will give us money.\n \n9 May\nWe shot them, probably more than a hundred. And they do not end there. Filth. Hate. Pooh yesterday bitten snork. His time shot, but still the wrist he Pooh bitten through.\nNight. I can not sleep. Pooh, poor, terrified screams. His wrist was swollen and festered. Nauchnik threw up his hands, they say, can not do anything. Bitch. We live, by the way, in one of the huts behind the bunker. They were there two, but we and one missing. Although I do not believe so. Move further out to this idiot whining from us!...\nGod, that's me... perhaps it's me because of overwork. Okay, try to sleep.\n \n10mApril\nscary headache. It seems that rolls inside a lead balloon. Mlyayaya... Interestingly, all of our well... Apparently, the pressure fell. Happens. Today, when getting out of the barracks, Krivoy tsepanul butt jamb and accidentally pulled the trigger. The bullet flew within a centimetre of my head. I hate him. I remember him, although he is very apologetic. I know it is specially... He wanted to kill me!\n \nDamn, what a nightmare. Ugh. Now kill the zombies were incomparable pleasure, unable to vent anger at least for someone. One so plaintively say, 'Mom-ah...' when a bullet he carried a half a head.\n \nI shot and laughed. I probably never did laugh... barely calmed down.
                        \n \n11 May \nToday Krivoy Sanya fought, Pooh could barely separate them. His wrist had already turned blue, and he could not move his fingers.

They are obviously up to something.\n \nshoot the zombies and snorks, almost to the X-16 reached. They returned to the barracks and went to sleep.\n \n12 May\nThey are up to something against me... I saw how they look at me... I hate... but I did not do anything to them...\n \n13 May\nnight I did it. I went to the barracks, where they sat and played cards. They even smiled and greeted me. Two-faced creature! Why do they so?\n \nThey still thought I was joking when I raised the gun... And I laughed and pulled the trigger. They cried and begged me not to kill them... They said they did not understand... They said I was crazy... I? Crazy?! Ha-ha! Brad!\n \nI shot until I ran out of bullets in the horn...\n \nAnd then... I do not remember... I remember that I hollowed at the door of the bunker and asked them to open and shouted that I kill the enemies... that's not my fault that their were my 'companions' ...\n \n14 May\nSitting around the bunker. Walk around zombie... I... I suddenly realized what he had done. I killed their friends. Those who shared with me shelter and bread, which covered my back...\n \nI sobbed and wailed so that even a zombie feared to approach me... I am a monster... I hate myself...\n \nThis is the last entry... hard for me to write... hands are shaking... I can not see very, Tears filled my eyes... I feel like something pressing on my brain...

Or trampled ' No While I was still alive, must be fought... Well though, that for some reason I can say. Recorder is set to include the sound of my voice, batteries have enough time. Maybe my writing at least someone can help...\n \nSo, in order. My name is Vitaly Andreev in the fourth year of the Zone I, a veteran single parent. Once was in freedom, but that was years ago. Today... I do not remember the date! Me? I do not remember any dates! Even my birthday! Well, let today be the first day. In the morning at the Agroprom would wait ejection in the destroyed railway tunnel. Due to the large number of anomalies where the detector had not determined who was hiding controller. I even did not have time to raise the weapon... It is believed that the man who fell under the influence of the controller is not capable of intellectual activity, and is a regular zombie. At least, people who survived after the death of controlling their creation, do not remember anything... My body is totally controlled It, but I keep a clear mind, I can talk or even move his head a little. At his... Stae? Detachment? Group? Well, let it be a group. In his group, except for me, three more zombies varying degrees of preservation, a pair of dense marsh and 6-8 dogs. Specifically about the dogs can not tell, they are constantly running around, but hard for me to twist my head to count them... Talk to me, too difficult, so enough for today.
                        \n \nDay 2.\nDeco hungry. And drink. 'I never thought that zombies can have such desires! Interestingly, he feeds his servants? Or, when people kick the bucket, the new recruits? The dogs I saw, ate jerboa. Finally withdrew from their seats. We move to the swamp.\n \nParticipated in His... Or ours? Hunting. Dogs rescued from a pair of dense swarms of monsters fatter, and I shot them. Or he shot them? But how? He got no weapons... From me? Controller of me shot two dense... Funny sounds, do not you?\n \nI've been a damn thing I can not find it funny! You would take my place! What am I doing? A minute ago he was ready to tear all hands... It seems his influence still affects... Where am I going? What? Neeeet! I will not have it! Radioactive raw meat! Neeee...(Indiscriminate gurgling, passing in squelching).\n \nThen we drank water from the radioactive swamps. Now I'm just a living corpse. But I can fairly say.\n \nDay 3.\nToday we ran into the military.\nAnd he a good tactician - rushed forward dogs and zombies, while their soldier was falling, I went closer and laid him.\n \nI had to eat human flesh. I do not like warriors, but not as much... Wow, I can still joke... Only the humor is very much black turns out... Interestingly, I have not slept for three days, and do not want to! Although some pluses in my situation. Only his head begins to ache.\n \nDay 4.\nDo you understand why he is busy with the flesh in the group. They are in fact no good there! But today the whole day production was not, and we ate one. Interesting organization NZ. In the evening came across the same two flesh, and he captured both. But the group has begun a strange confusion, and we ate another. Confusion immediately stopped. It seems he can not control too many things. By the way, he sleeps. Not long, but at this time, control a little bit weaker. I was the creature holding fast, but a dog yesterday, managed to escape.
                        \n \nDay 5.\nIt seems colder. It seems that because I do not feel the temperature. But in the morning frost on the grass lay. I began to feel the group. If you concentrate, I can even see the eyes of someone from them. Damn, what is happening to me? Today, again, killed a man. A simple personal stalker, and I do not feel anything. I did not care.\n \nI understand that while he was asleep, I can not control someone from the group. While very little, dog - easy, zombies - heavier. They seem to be his nervous activity is left, so you have to monitor their every move. That's because an ambush! In other control can and is - no...\n \nDay 6.\nIt seems he feels something. Today came up to me and stared into his eyes. Pretended tables. Something must be done. Now night. He fell asleep. I know what to do.\n \nCome on, dear, go syudaaa... Another small step. So, now take my rifle... An idiot, I said take it, but do not leave... So... Raised... Shutter cocked, well... Now, quietly, quietly... here just five metres.

When I dared to raise their eyes, then saw that the glow of the Perfect faded, and his voice became softer in my soul. Tears gushed from the eyes and the rage came into my heart when I heard his words:
Faithful to me! - Said he: my enemies close and become more!
Great - I cried: Tell us who they are and we will crush them with their faith and the strength of your weapons!
After a silence of eternity, which struck me as torture, he uttered: 'I know your strength, and I see that your hearts are burning ruthlessness to my enemies, and you are ready to sacrifice their lives for me.

\n \n13.06.09

\n- I sit in the bar... hell, something needs to be addressed. Money is ending, but clothing was not the same - an old AK often wedge, shabby suit. And with work, as luck would calm - do not have anyone Nitsche, snickering, bastards... s-eh-eh, I'm going to Voronin, General dolgovskomu, we can have him CHE... Well, another glass...

\n14.06

\n- Well, was at Voronin. I said to Yantar to walk there from scientists working completely, but short of hands. Damn, so far away and the place is not sugar - a hotbed snorks and zombies, many stalkers there were killed. On the other hand, nowhere to go, want to eat like a wolf... Voronin has helped - rearm, and medkits and food supplied... If all succeed, must be put down. Well, in a way...

\n16.06

\n- finally can pipets. The germs so much adventure to find his ass. Only went to the territory - here bloodsucker for stealing boxes. I wanted to hide, but fuck it - spotted. Poper at me, I gave one part, another - zero attention. I barely managed to pull a knife but his jab in the skull - a little bit more, and scrambled eggs... Oooh, next to a pack of dogs ran - automatic recharge forgot, managed only two shot - ferrule end. One with a gun put, the other does in the heat under your ass kicked with his legs - yet ochukhivayemsya, I strangled the last, leaped into the bitch's throat would break. Fuck it, I loaf of bread grated. Well, the one which gave pendalya, managed to head off armaturinoy break - the good, the iron plant enough. It was true, and good - has found an artifact, such as Crystal. Good thing, scientists can shake off a certain amount. But already for half a kilometre to go to the lake Yantar ran into byurera - thing that is. I shot him, of course, only he got me a couple of bricks... blah, still hurts to horror, right in the pole attached... Okay, good rest, it's time to move on...

\n19.06

\n- rested among scientists. After being wounded in the chest. Prior to the bunker scientists have steps left, as I Zombar vypersya. I have not had time to utter a word - he is in me a pistol with three bullets put. I swam in the eyes of all, the pain excruciating, her legs gave way and I fell... vaguely remember when I heard some screams, the rattle of the door bin... then more shots, Snuffles cry Zombar... then... hell, a damn do not remember, probably lost consciousness. Jumped into the bunker, bandages, a young guy sitting next to a scientist. He took me out. A good guy, we chatted with him. He, therefore, not very interested in science, but like all mysteries disassemble. Zone A Well it's a solid neponyatka, here it is for scientists and went. I asked him about a job, said job of work there, dirty, true, but what is - at the lake Khrenova cloud snorks gathered, it is necessary to remove them from there. Here is rest cautious and forward...

\n21.06

\n- Well, the lake, I cleaned out. I am for this, Sakharov, chief among scientists there, grenades supplied in order for trouble not to climb briskly. It was fun to see how snorks throws in different directions. I even a single bullet did not spend. Sakharov was rewarded, as it is, money given decent, I gave him another artifact showed Tuk he almost jumped with joy, said this to him and not enough. And for his money rolled sugar. I was about to leave, but he asked to stay, said his hands need work, a hand in the laboratory, promised to pay, not elegant, of course, but in the zone all representations pennies are good...

\n16.07

\n- almost a month. All the while he worked at the Sakharov subsidiary - then bring it, go there. Well and good, I was even smarter, so much sugar knows everything... In the evening the conversation turned to the factory, which stands on a hill, somewhere in the hundred yards from the bunker. Sakharov said at the plant has an underground laboratory with some psy-emitter, they say, because of this and a lot of Zombar haunting Yantar. Another said that there is a prototype of protection from radiation and that he wanted to explore the installation, which is there. There just are not willing to go down and cut down the radiator. Sakharov and his scientific organization is ready to fuck off mad grandmother for the radiator... features, offering tempting, but dangerous as... In the underground so rubbage usual... But what if the prototype did not survive the radiation and I turn into a zombie... no, I will not... I still went crazy...

\n18.07

\n- I thought two days on the words of Sakharov and the chase that he was willing to pay. Broken down, walked over to him and told him to say, I'm ready to go into the catacombs. He replied that he had come to us at night is a stalker and agreed to go too, so I go with a partner. My name is Vasya, shows that an experienced stalker, not one year zone tramples. Sakharov has supplied us for a full program - issued superpuperzaschitnye suits, brand-new assault rifles and pistols, ammunition, prototypes of radiation, medical kits, food, etc, etc, etc, radios and recorders... Recorders are not just granted, I only then realized that - in the catacombs, we could easily die, and those successors who may come after us, this infa on tape can be useful. Yes, perspektivka opens cheerless. And the hell with it, do at least something worthwhile in his life...

\n19.07

\n \n(More blog is in audio format) - to move through the territory of the plant... (As the machine-gun fire could be heard cursing and running mate) your mother, well, Zombar here... on, bitch, for you!... Fu-u-x, no one yet, we go further... won two front...

	<text>Day 1

\n \nI'm in the zone. And what about her saying so? It looks ordinary field with broken roads, which is complete in some provinces. Occasionally you can see piles of construction debris from standing around with signs 'radioactivity. Stalker conductor, who agreed to take me through the checkpoint to the camp newcomers, said that it will still remain from the first crash. Now late in the evening, so the guide says to go directly to Sidorovich we will not - he does not like the later reviews. Well, okay. The conductor said I would sleep in any house. When he reached the camp I see six houses with broken windows. From two of them were only part of the core. Near the fire sat for seven people, something animatedly discussing. At my direction, they do not even look. I decided not to intrude, and lay down in the nearest house, his backpack under his head, and fell asleep.

\n \nDay 2

\n \nI was awakened by a bright light in the face. Today was a sunny day, as yesterday, explained the conductor, a rather rare phenomenon for the zone. Usually there overcast and rain, often acidic. Wearing a backpack, I went to Sidarovich. He lives in the basement than it resembles a bomb shelter - huge heavy doors on the street and thick security door on the course in his 'den' .
Sidorovich was fat man about 50 years, with a bald head. He sat back on me, so I could not see his face. When he heard the door slam, he asked without turning around:
\n- Khabar brought?
\nI immediately remembered that swag here called the extracted artifacts, and all that goes on sale merchants.
\n- No, - I answered honestly.
\n- So what the hell are you here brings you here? - Still not turning around, asked Sidorovich.
\n- I'm new here...
\n- Really? - Sidorovich finally deigned to turn to me and I could see his face more attentively - mustache, little pig eyes and red nose.
\n- Yes. I only arrived yesterday.
\n- Hm. Who brought you here?
\n- Stalker nicknamed Cutter.
\n- carver, carver... yes I remember this. And he usually does not cause fools, so I have a job for you, so tell your baptism in the Zone, heh, heh. And this is what the job - bring me the tail pseudodog. Of the weapons given to thee a knife. Misc fetch once myself. I'll pay you for it... well, let's say, 500 MNT. Agreed?
\nThe fact that I told the carver, I learned that the first task in Sidor better to take - this is a very strong impact on your reputation. But it also lecture in the livestock area, I learned that from pseudodog alone will not risk to leave even experienced stalkers, what can we say about me. Moreover, the psevdopsy singly do not hunt. But do nothing, and I am under the watchful gaze Sidorovich agreed.
\n- Loading.
\n- Well, nice. Here's your knife. PDA, as I see you have, so do not get lost. Let's Go.
\nI turned around and opened the door.
\n- Stop! - I stopped. - Yes, I joked about pseudodog. Consider the test you passed. Go to Wolf, he's here watching over newcomers. He will give you the PM and a pack of cartridges. How to talk to him, come to me, I'll give you the job. By the way, as you call it?
\n- Anton Zaitsev.
\n- Ah, no, we do not accepted. Can you imagine what drove some idea. And though... will be called the Cross. Or Anton Cross, if you are so fond of the name. And now march to Wolf, and let me calm finish.

\n \n[Many pages missing, some muddy, and they can not read]

\n \nDay 63.

\n \nNow I'm in a bar '100 Rads'. Of the equipment I have LR-300, the next version of the American M-4, Colt, two grenades, three bandages and first aid kit. The money is there, I just just a job - regular cleaning of the mutants.
This time was a pack of blind dogs. In order not to look for trouble, I crept up to him and threw into the midst of a flock of two grenades. An amusing spectacle - to see how fly discarded blast dogs. The surviving puppy, I just shot out of a brand-new LR-300. Considering the number of killed my dogs (and this proved to be problematic - some of them was a bloody mess), I went for a reward.
The bartender greeted me cordially - unlike Sidor, who sullenly inspected brought my swag.
I reported on the destruction of 15 blind dogs. The bartender sighed, and told me as a fee 'Fireball' , a bottle of vodka, bread, a pot of stew and tonic.
The drink I drank once, but a bottle of vodka I had stored for later - because of supply problems antirads, it is very expensive, so people started to stock locally produced vodka.
Finally, Barman said that 'the duty announced an additional set in their ranks and I would have been happy there.
I said I'd think about it, though long ago decided everything for himself: 'Debt' - it's not for me. I thought to go to the Military, to 'Freedom' . Seasoned stalkers were told that the people there are happy, relaxed, and always happy to see new visitors. Perhaps, tomorrow and go.
Here's a Christmas tree, paper ends. A new there - here she deficit. We'll have to record on tape.

  \n \nDay 64.

  \n \nAs I yesterday and decided, I went to artskladam.
In the Zone was as always cloudy. Before I reached the base without incident - in the way no one met, except that two 'Electros'.
Before the entrance to the base I was stopped in a strange stalker armor. The massive armor plates covering the entire body, feet and hands were visible hydraulic boosters, united into a single system 'joints.
He asked me what I'm doing here and why he was there. I replied that I wanted to join them. Stalker immediately moved and freed the passage, saying that I should go to a two-story house with a guard.
The very basis of freedom is a typical picture for the settlements in the zone - scattered piles of construction material. Standing beside the main building of the monument broke in half - top lying on the ground. It seems that the local inhabitants of particularly do not care.
Income before security guards, I told them that I want to join, and they do not hesitate to let me, stating that he must go to the second floor, to Lukash.
To the second floor, I saw a very Lukash and two guards, dressed in the same armor that svobodovtsa at the entrance to the base. Along with these giants, Lukash looked dwarf. I greeted him and explained his purpose of arrival:
  \n- My name is Anton Cross, you can simply cross. I would like to join you.
  \n- Yes? And how do we know that you're not a spy 'Duty'?
  \n- I dislike them.
  \n- This is for words, dude. But in reality... In general, this: go down one floor below to Miser. He will give you the job. Run - conquer the respect and reputation we have, get a new kombez and gift. Agreed?
  \n- And what kind of job?
  \n- And that's your own Miser says. Even the outfit will help if you have it tight.
\nI am descended from Lucas to Miser.
Miser was a short, intelligent-looking man with a mustache and glasses.
I approached him and said that Maine has sent Lukash. Miser slyly looked at me and said:
  \n- Okay, dude. In the village, not far from here, bred bloodsuckers. Yes, yes, they. As you already understood, your task - to remove these creatures. In this respect, and receive a gift from me - a rare artifact, 'Crystal' is called. I see that the weapons you have no skill, so give me your Volyn here, and I'll give you in return SG-550, weapons powerful and reliable. With him these bastards where it will be easier to knead.
In a village in the evening not poke your nose - there in the evening not only bloodsuckers prowling around, but some - who are worse. You'll have to wait until tomorrow. And now you can walk and relax, but within, of course. Oh, and here's another dude - not meddle in the swamp, not only that there is a minefield and radiation, so even in a small house sits crazy jerk and shoot anyone who will get to it under review.
\nHaving said all that, we got it I was out.

  \n \nday 65

  \n \nI woke up at 11 o'clock. The sky was always overcast.
The village I saw from afar. Even away from her evil exuded an aura of death. But doing nothing, and I went to their homes.
Come down to houses, I pick up on the roof of one of them and start looking look right to me monsters.
Yeah, that's one. Lifting and tselyus him straight in the temple - it is their weak point. In the gold! Legs bloodsucking faltered and he fell to the ground.
At the sound of gunfire and ran the rest of creation. I hid behind a chimney, so they would not have discovered. Bloodsucker has come to slain colleague. Here is the chance! Look out and throw them under the feet of two grenades. There were two deafening explosions. Look out again and see now - bloody clumps scattered in a radius of five metres from the explosion. One of them chopped off his legs, but he is still alive. I came up, I get the Colt from its holster and three shots ceasing his ordeal.
Everyone must go. I notice that - something wrong - the sky is red, begins to hear a low rumble. Oh, damn! Eject!
Headlong run to the nearest house, jumping into the basement...

  \n \nDay 66.

  \n \nI do not know what's happening to me... During the ejection head gripped like a vice. Now I could barely move - my body could hardly listen to me. And I want to eat... meat... raw meat... I want MEAT!</text>

  \n \nthe 13th day
\nWhy did I go into the dark valley, because the landfill was so good... That's because the bartender, it took him to get some documents from one of the bunkers.
I stumbled on the bandits, long skirmish, there aren'ta lot of ammunition... I found some notes and plans for the dead 'kids' .
One of them resulted in a pipe sticking out of the ground. Near a bubbling Fruit Punch, I hope nothing is spoiled. Uh, you... some clips to my arms, eating and first aid kit.
Taak, this note is no longer needed. F)
Shot a couple of crows for fun. No one did not seem to hear.

  \n \nthe 14th day
\nFuuh, how much did these hooligans was in this building. Nitsche, like Bron'ka still hangs well, although the hole is already decent.
He filled many machines that barely move. I'll have to drop the dump shake off all the good green newcomers.

  \n \nthe 15th day
\nIt seems nothing I bought all the way, running into a flock tushkanov. Hardly had time to throw down everything and climb up a concrete block near a stop.
The devil! Still, one creature to bite my leg managed. Used kit. A strange in her appearance... Well, okay, apparently helped.

  \n \nthe 16th day
\ntook all the trash in a landfill, pushed this inexperienced idiot... Hahaha, now there is little money on ammunition.
By the way, must still obtain the documents for the bartender, and then swear to be.

  \n \nthe 17th day
\nThere's something rumbling in the stomach. We ought to have a meal... No, definitely something with the things from the cache is not a gangster. The remnants of food thrown out, the taste disgusting.
Gotcha gangster beginner, died quickly. Still, bullets and even silly, but fly fast.

  \n \nthe 18th day
\nHow strangely began to feel themselves and the chin itches constantly, as if no lice infested, still need to be clipped beard.
I found a large building with a crane. Like here on the description is unknown laboratory must pay a visit. I hope that the problems will be small.

  \n \n19-day
\nAll, it's time to tie with stalking... Spent almost the entire supply of ammunition to the bandits, even grenades left. Seems someone experienced jettisoned.
Here's a pancake, top of these monsters is also an RPG shmalyayut... Well, quite oborzeli... We must wait until night, when they fell to sleep. By the way I see a small trailer
north and something like a conveyor belt. Sorry dosimeter croaked after my fall on the ground. Well, nothing... Vodka deryabnu and go to sleep, maybe blow over...

  \n \n...
\nI'm sorry I probably slept there: head is aching, itching and aching, something like even firmer steel. He broke the knife with one hand, when, as usual, played them.
Still, a strange thing this radiation, you never know what it all ends...
That evening, although it is unclear... all in some strange contours delineated... probably drunk or bodunischa, it's time to go pay a visit to our brother gops.

  \n \nthe 20th day
\nNo, well this mess... bandyukov I flunked, but the fact that the top, had some trouble - mothers turned. But near the brick chimney has found dozens of clips for his Abakan.
It seems that the flux: teeth ached for several hours. Dumb place this laboratory... only went so once some devilry going on in advance.

  \n \n...
\nThis is because snorks infection jumpy... Well I have a bit of shooting, hit in the head immediately.
AAA... a bastard still crept back and managed to claw slash on the back... Damn, it hurts the same. Well, nothing like their hooves make a lot of money.

  \n \nthe 21st day
\neat so there was... move deeper into the terrifying. Today, almost did not get a stool in the forehead... Maybe even sleep in the elevator...
Someone at the bottom heavily walks... lower jaw barely moves, has reduced pain... No, you must throw away up to heal a little, but then somehow I feel strangely

  \n \n22nd day
\nafraid for myself... unable to recharge the machine, his fingers in fright pulled the bolt, along with the contents.
Bumped into byurera did not think I'm that smart in terms of uvorachivaniya of bricks.
Flooded while intact on the surface.
I had to soak milksop bare hands... How appetizing he caruncle...
I try to keep myself in hand, armor is barely alive... trying to finally get out of this nightmare...

  \n \ntwenty-third day... machine not... food, no... there is almost no armor... and even that throw, it is still pointless. How to pass through the radiation field do not know.
\nhead ached so that it seems the bottom half is about to fall off. Well while dragging his backpack, although all that was left a couple of some legs and strange stones.
I think I'm numb... Legs like the taste of anything, stones thrown, they nafig me.
Oh, found the bandit did not even notice as ran up to him... Figa behold I sprinter... Inundated with a pair of punches... Here select podamsya a maniac... otherwise it can not be called.

  \n \nthe 24th day
\nBrrr Hrrr tasty body and blood of some kind... not thought of hunger because changing tastes... Wandered into the kind of crap with upright... like the inscription on the house
Flammable... xs what... ought to go into the house opposite and meal... Well, at least by the body yesterday...

  \n \nthe 25th day
\nAaaarrhrhhhh that with my chin... I am now probably similar to Cthulhu... devil in my head just thinking about the blood... What am I?

  \n \nToday, my group landed in the plant in the Gaza Yantar. Scientists want us to cut off the installation, emitting some sort of field, due to which people turn into a zombie. For the protection we were given special helmets. Landing is scheduled for 10:40.

\n11:27

  \n \nThere is strong resistance from the zombie. No casualties reported. Destroyed about twenty (20) zombies. There are signs of mutants of the third class. Request support from the air.

  \n \nShit! Spinner has covered! Flew by, gave a volley of bunks and crashed somewhere in the factory! Probably covered with radiation. The head is very sore.

  \n \nWhew! Finally, the end of this damned uchebka, all these preparations... especially drill. On the parade ground in all weathers
you walk a measured pace, but for what? As if all my life I will participate in the parade, heh, heh, well, I do not.

  \n \nmy first day...
\nThis is the whole day at the cordon, they say, it's not the worst place in the Zone, so too, and the word-then what... 'Zone'!
During the day quietly, just somewhere in the distance shots and grandparents say it again, or bandits attacked a lone stalker
they would all freebie, the crowd at one of which would be selected, or someone from the beast to fight back. They say that sometimes approach the gate,
have to shoot these bastards. Rather would with his AK to shoot, and then uchebke a couple of times on the fire went out.
Okay it then, NAV should be mom to write a letter, it is true about all kinds of mysteries of nature writing will not, do not know, maybe grandparents
Tales been told to me, about all sorts of mutants, about the anomaly, the release of some sort, although in appearance were serious. I noticed the elderly
all vodka consumed, type in the prophylaxis of radiation, shitty! We know them, these goals, 'preventive'!
In uchebke sergeants, also in the evenings all kinds of 'banquet' rolled, and then the company system, on the evening 'puncture' Stand up!
So they find a cigarette 'fashion' , the money they 'just barely' not enough to continue the celebration, find them all! Although burst. I thought all! 'Hello arrived' - here the same, I hope batter will not.

  \n \nEvening...
\nSome Daisy into my head, all nonsense. And the 'old' all sit drinking, where they climbs. I do not know, but I think so, or
in fact, but for the whole day I did not hear the singing of birds, only crows circling in the sky all. Sunset, nice-how!
Aha. Fuck! Che was, but...? Perhaps a wolf howl. Santa laugh, what they say here wolves, it pseudodog. Heh-heh, they laugh
How would I know who it was howling, I'm urban, and that the dogs are, figs knows. I'll go get ready for bed,
tired after the first day. Ha! Like no Che did. Beds me standing at the window, opened the window, and then bit stuffy in the barracks.
Fuck! Martyn contract soldier who is a 'young' he called, he is somehow, and more vodka asked to bring. Where it here in the sticks you find it!

\nMorning...
\nSuch sleepless nights I have ever had. Santa singing by singing, then someone from them what it is not divided. Ass, in one word.
All night long, then a howl, then laughter, then some groans, and even staged a fire.
It is said of mutants were shot, what fuckin mutants, either reading too much science fiction, or vodka census. All through the night under a blanket lying, creepy... but what fuck spine, elephants in the skin running! My pal Lehi lucky he was in Special Forces airborne, and I... in the ass! That's where I got!
This afternoon, the first time the post will go on the tower! They said the most important post! Cleaned his AK, but UEFA to clean it, I do not even shoot out of it. Neither Che, I shoot out of it yet! Let's see what sort of mutants, I'll fix it... no, I like her, but, vendetta
for my 'quiet' night!

  \n \nIn the post...
\nclimbed the tower. Cool! My first post! At the dinner eaten up pile, Whew! Smoke a cigarette or something, although the statute and can not
but if no one sees, it is possible. On the horizon, everything seems quiet. Beauty! No office, and Lafayette, it is true the night I stop please.
Nitsche, get used to it... Shit! Che is the Che for the firing! It's like Kiruha the other tower waters. Between the trees a stalker, or a bandit, too, shoots. That bastard! I'll Wait a him! That's because scum, he is still somewhere grenades scored! NAV, I will take it on the fly, do not leave... Ay! Mom, it hurts, I can not breathe, that is... Blood Blood Why so, since this is my first post was a cold, why? Why? He's still shooting? That bastard, shoots, with-page-relativistic...</text>

  \n \nTomorrow Jora seasoned go into a pass. We go into the woods just north of Military. Jora got this military helmet fastened inside the small copper mesh. Under the helmet wants to put some crap from the foil and wire. The whole bar above him whinnying. Apparently the roof a man moved. Ah, that zone does to people... Since taking a 'Beretta' a couple of grenades and 'Storm' is, 'Duty' last week gave for the salvation of their quad. We leave in the morning.<!-- Changed 'Zhorik' to 'Jora'- Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16-->

  \n \nRecord 2

  \n \ncame out before dark, before the Military arrived without incident. On the way to the barrier fell asleep bloodsucker, fell two shots from the 'Beretta' .Meters for 200 of the barrier heard terrible cries, Jora said that he knows the workaround. Let's go a little farther east. We stopped at the edge of a forest for the trees Pripyat. Let's go west, to the copse where I last saw some concrete garbage and 'Hot' eternal.<!-- Changed 'Zhorik' to 'Jora'- Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16-->

  \n \nRecord 3

  \n \nWhen they reached the road they saw two men left, like the 'Monolith' . Lay in a roadside ditch, did not seem to notice. When Stoned went racing across the road and went through the forest. Noticed zombie Jora it with 'Vintorez' clapped like no one heard. At Zombar found some documents, there is no time to deal, in a bar for a look at what they are. We stopped at the tree from which the 'Burning Down' hangs. Good hanging, we are not seen.

  \n \nRecord 4 (apparently made much later than the rest)

  \n \nMonitor Dmitry today showed me a little of the Truth! He told me about halo Monolith... His story gave me strength that was left me in this impious place. The words wrong, which we keep in captivity in a basement bunker of the forest, planted in my soul the greatness of his doubts, but now I have no doubt! Coach explained to me that is incorrect, with whom I came to this forest - worthy to be called a minister of the Monolith, so magnificent I just put it on the path of truth. Wrong is - an enemy of the Shining, and therefore must be destroyed. Mentor Dmitry noticed my doubts when I asked, 'Why kill the alien, because we had been of the same clan before my enlightenment, perhaps, better to wait for another? But the coach said that if the greatest wrong is not opened his eyes once, then this is His will.

  \n \nRecord 5.

  \n \nI fulfilled his wish! Wrong shouted before his death, cried on deception, attempted to dissuade me of the truth of my faith. But I was adamant. Mentor Dmitry will be proud of me because I have fulfilled the will of the Shining. I already know that only the elect of our brothers are Akolitami it, only those who knows not doubt his strength. Hopefully, I will have the patience to complete this sacred way, and someday see His brilliance... And now I must return to the post in the bunker and to report to mentor the triumph of justice. All things wrong, I had brought with him a lot of them along with clothing, but Monolith gives me strength. I hear your call, of Perfect!

  \n \nRecord 6

  \n \nI again sent to the test. Mutants living in the woods, blocked my path. But I know - he once again wants to make sure my loyalty to his faith! I will go through everything. I have used all their skills, but proved that I am worthy to be called His servant. To survive in battle with the mutants, I had to use some items of clothing incorrect, killed me yesterday. And Mutants quivered in an unequal battle, because he fought on my side! I survived, on the Great!

  \n \nRecord 7.

  \n \nWhere can I... I do not understand where I am... Some forest... And the name... I can not remember my name! On my flak jacket and helmet with sewn letters 'Jora', but I do know that it - not my... Where I took it? And how to get to people?<!-- Changed 'Zhorik' to 'Jora'- Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16-->

  \n \nOh, no... That I killed Jora... His friend... (Hear the cry). Why I do it?? He also asked them to leave him alive, to spare... He tried to say that I am mad psi-unit, as it... Burner... ? Yes Now I know what it is. Clearly, where are all the new Monolith, and where so many are disappearing lone stalkers who have decided to get to the north. Luckily, I was wearing his helmet in a battle with mutants - I do not remember this, but after reading their records, I was horrified! I was one of Monolith! I was crazy! And maybe now??<!-- Changed 'Zhorik' to 'Jora'- Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16-->

	<text>Introduction
\nYour team is sent to the object X-18.
\nSomeone opened the door at the complex.
\nOn arrival, your group should be divided into three parts.
Their tasks are as follows:
\nThe first - the penetration of the compound, with the discovery of other people, objects destroyed.
\nThe second - to take a position on the surface, in the building and cover around it. If you find extraneous, objects destroyed.
\nThe third - to take up positions in the area of closely spaced bridge to cover the most likely route of the enemy.

  \n \n* Further recording obtained by decoding the linguistic program, the owner of the CPC votes to transfer information group commander, for some reason the record was not automatically deleted *

  \n \nI have that again, the commander of the first group? Not well, lucky me... There are set aside nagging Comrade Captain.

  \n \nfor the landing ready.

  \n \nTo the right of the entrance to the building covering a man found dead, judging by their clothing, apply to the bandits. The corpse of a fresh gunshot wounds.

  \n \ncame into the room. It was found a few more people, all the corpses without rigor mortis, all belong to the bandits. Apparently their opponent was a man. He shot quite accurately, but not military, most likely some kind of stalker.

  \n \nget down to the entrance of the object. Discovered the corpse of another gangster. Status and time of death is approximately equal to that of the upper.

  \n \nThe front door facility is open to the plowing. Damage to the doors do not seem to have included was the key. I received an order to capture the newcomer, but his inability to capture, hold destruction.

  \n \nAccording to the schemes that we have only one way out, decided not to go down, and gain a foothold on this floor. The examination revealed a floor large number of anomalies Class 'Hot' . Also found two badly burned corpse of corpses, the description would fit in being 'Snork' . Also found dead in a suit scientist. The scientist discovered the CCP, recently it has been withdrawn information including the code of the door leading to a lower floor. The positions chosen. We are waiting for a 'guest' .

  \n \nThere is a movement upward, one person, my conclusions are correct. It moved slowly, cautiously.

  \n \n...We lost!... I believe that the detention facility's impossible!... DESTROY THE OBJECTIVE!

  \n \n* Based on the sensors, the owner has received many wounds, voices dropped to a whisper.*

  \n \n(the top torn off )... find and kill that louse!

  \n \nAnd in general - I was wrong to listen to Tolstoy. He was also a monster, brought called on Salvage! Promised something, you bastard, promised! Actually, what? It's not us it on fraerka roe, and brought it to us, oh well would you fraerok... The Wolf turned out to be worse than the guard at Volokolamsk... As he calculated the Old Grey? He just came up in the hands of a damn no! Asked to smoke, but what in response? No hello, no sorry, no rut lohovskogo - just a knife in the throat. So much Fraher. Apparently a former cop, for all that shabby. Ehhh, what I do here prikanal something... Sitting in a hole he could now, vodyaru jam tarts and feel, so no, canned fool... And how well it all started...

  \n \nbegan and the truth - as in a fairy tale. After a second spell in gaol (for example, sat on the little things. Especially, myself, heh, heh... Otherwise it would have surfaced about the collector - and would have covered a year or two, but not small, but good. During the arrest, the NDA...) returned home to his boys, in the yard darling. Beauty! And so goes - not yet sat down, did not see the house well, and should sit - and on you, paradise, and not the yard! Guys who anyone could do. Kolyano Kachka killed, though. In the disassembly useful, but there Tale Timy Black harnessed, but against Kolyano... Well, he is guilty - those kids only an idiot now, high lifts. While I was sitting, they are generally entered into force, rose. Trample down, they say, even the gypsies - but those cops were purchased, nobody is seizing control of... Other pals - Vasya Bruise - planted, but not for trifles. As lawlessness. When drunk (klikuhu he did not himself have given life to bruise and is) not that girl lapnul, but it turned out that her daughter, or sister of a packed. At paw who should have given the prosecutor's office, that's no Vasey. Well at least not for an unpopular article, or he really bad on the area would be lived. According to article 159 was closed, however, to its fullest. I once knew - whinnying half, that's a must, bruise - and for fraud! Yes, he punks cards lost! What do you mean cheat... Another pal, although he was always muddy, and we are not mates with him apart, and got cool. What to do - even I did not catch up, but he tachila such that potbellied beavers, and they do not have. I thought I did not even know me, but it is the opposite! He came up, he handed crab, 'with the arrival of you, bro!' said a restaurant called, on both. We sat a good idea, but when I looked at the menu, the price, Che has become something dumb, Babble then I was not particularly. And Sanya says - bro, no market, you there parilsya, and I grew fat here, so take a walk, do not think treat. About how. I it at the moment even bought - it hides UEFA something... But what made me get it? The smell of the prison, or worn-out sneakers ' And it won as it turned out.

  \n \nAfter a couple of days san came again. He says: 'Do you want to, well, get up, like, better than me?' - And I told him straight what I say, dark. Come on, brother, directly, does not suit me at lohah walk to me as a child threw up. He opened his mouth as much, did not expect. And he said, 'Oh, and I in you, so I was not mistaken...' Why me wrong? Well, he explained what was happening.

  \n \nWhile I was sitting, he nadybal channel black, utter crap some research. Yes nadybal so that it now shines Degree! Type, there are rare items from the Ukraine through it only in the institutions are, where they Botany our four-eyed under the microscope view. A Sana'a for a fee of hard cash! But more and theirs thanks, and in such nerds everywhere have hairy arms, so I switched on. It turns out, Sana'a itself somehow these dumb thing, artifacts, find, but you can pass. And where they are? And here was all like in the alley between the Sign and Marx, all of the concepts. There are those guys hrenoviny to Salvage greedy. And bear to sell them. Just do not always convey. Here Sanya and invited me to take the smart kids, but under the Chernobyl hit the road. Trip, said as he squints so bad... You'll find, said there is a place a huckster, Tolstoy, they call him, also sitting, for banditry true. He will enlighten your chaps and where to go and someone to wait, and then to collect them. And then I said, you'll pass, too, by Tolstoy. Godick there to fish, Ddlokhov potryasesh - for life in the gold will be. Well, I agree.

  \n \nI arrived, two people with him took. Tolstoy was a huge, bald, sweaty freak. I have about it beforehand bratvy learned - from the boundless, spun. But What are they doing - Sanya promised to help, and Bubble hunting, as much as possible in the movie houses where such a square, which pretended authority, in the train brings the thief: 'You thief, a gentleman of fortune! stole, drank, in jail! '- this is where morality was such that the type of life you have, the thieves, boring, and her romanticism is calling you, especially so, with a sneer, that sort of came to himself. Fraerskoe movies, comedy, and the thought sunk into my soul... So I had to for the sake of Salvage for the future of the nits general ponyatki search, though sickening. Well, he told us it would be easy at first gave. Meet, says it is necessary, one boy. He broke down tsatsek nemeryano, there are different, the names do not remember, all the sea some: Medusa, Fish... Crap, in short, yes me and the drum, what is there. The main thing - when the amount of fat called, it will give us for the fact that this shpanets naryl - all I could to not to show that these attendants are not kept in the hands of old, even after the collector of the deceased. It merely passed - Gray lay down on the road, like a wounded, but moaned that over half a kilometre heard about it, but shpanets probably sick of people not used to seeing - to help lomanulsya, but so that the bushes crackled. Well we met. Kostya's head and I in the kidneys. Although I do so for the species - after weighted knucklebone Kastsyan kid is a pass-long stay, but not to the understanding of my side stand, when it's done. I did have them type in the main, that's what! Thick seeing stuff that was dragged in a backpack, almost wrought with happiness. 'And what with the kid?' - Asks. And what with him... Resting, and said so. 'How?' He was then a living? ' Oh crud, I think, yes I Mokrushnikov in life is not recorded, once only was, and even then I'm not that collector... So about that nobody knows who they were and everything had fallen on the spot, one I'm alive, collector before his death, all shot, all of our gang, but I did not notice.

  \n \nshort, stout buhtet began, by saying that his witnesses are not necessary. And if so screwed up again, he would do away with us. Well, I was thinking we'll see who gets away with and when, but at this time to parse not reached. He gave us a second order, creature sweaty... Fraher, said there is one. Famous stalker. Who, I ask? What a 'stalker' such Che is this crap? But Tolstoy said - so the local hunters name, which can shmalyat protein in the eye, but a nose for the artifacts have - these were from fish yes Medusa. In short, local raiser. The fat of his talks with someone catches it, and, in short, U-raiser something nadobyval that the price does not yet have. The unique thing is kind. Well CHE... Job understandable.

  \n \nBut here we made a mistake with the little kids. That is a little something I and the boys on the full ogrebli. Although, as a look - im a lucky can still... And I'm here alive rot and decay. Fraher this just a former cop, Old Grey stabbed in the throat - so we do not beat, they are at the heart of mochkanuli to, but once on the ground, jumped on his back, and the weapon from behind the jump took. Shit, I'm such a movie just seen... Kostyan fool, and pushed him... What's going against the Kalash edged with something? ' Neto Kastsyan now. Well, I'll hide how was, and lay there until a square, damn, how could there be a square, mentyara that his pockets were rifled kids. Gray was like still alive was bubbled UEFA something... Finish it this ghoul. While he has not helped any molded like, with his throat slit something. Well, this is kind of wanted to go, I think - again I was gone, but I must! At this point, sneeze, as punks, as Snivel last! Mentyara did not even look for me - threw a grenade, tvaryuga... Hooked me, boys... So soon and I to you. There and we'll settle for my herd, but for your stupidity... Khrenova UEFA something... Our yard sorry I will not see... Beautifully there...</text>

  \n \n[START RECORDING]

  \n \n13.07.2011
\nThat's it!
Yesterday I called Lucas, said to collect belongings and immediately move to the barrier to Capua. They patted our Monolith pretty: the wounded have to base, lie for, and the dead - bury it away, so that no beasts stared at svezhatinku (we have to be completely happy only bloodsuckers out of the village is not enough!). I thought that would punish for yesterday, but no, type 'has high confidence' , blah...
Well, let - better than the barrier than in the cooler or the cook assistants.


  \n \n14.07.2011
\nin the morning got under way. I go to the detachment of the same 'elected' . I had to lay the hook on the hills, and then on the lawn near the swamp pig romp, but the earth is sometimes trembling. Andryukha said it psevdogigant. I saw this from afar, but how such a carcass through the barrier went unnoticed - no idea... So he was met by a minefield, you bastard! Nahr us a 'tank' in the rear.

\ncame to the location. So jolly was here! In spines passages metres wide and 5, two trench razvorochany, krovischa everywhere...
Cap said that before the monolith monsters sack, but a little too organized, though under control - first dog, heads 20-30, the flesh, and snorks psevdogigant. Matthew Fink, vice Capa said that if orders do not, then everything would have fallen here before the approach Monolith. First shot psevdopsov who managed a bunch of dogs, snipers drove the raft (those eyes on polmordy, the most vulnerable spot). Psevdogiganta drove grenades, and through the bushes lomanulsya back where you came.
And then, they did not even muster a yes losing count went Monolith...


  \n \n16.07.2011
\nlate yesterday restored barrier. We are with Andryukha sent me to a funeral command, here I first saw the fanatics Monolith. Guys like guys just kombezy some others, but three others in spacesuits, and outside tubes, rods, hinges. Matthew told me that it was 'ECWA' , or exoskeleton. Man it can load lug 200 pounds, without straining, or what gun to take the more impressive, such as the RPG. The only thing bad ekzy - by bullets and shrapnel almost save.


  \n \n18.07.2011
\nFifth Day on the barrier. It seems all is quiet. You should be happy, but my heart restless. In the Zone just did not happen, and even more so that's a lull. After dinner in our trench to come back in Cap and told me to come back tomorrow to the base. Says Lucas took away my collection, and around the Warehouse dolgovtsy began to appear, it is possible to raid to capture our database.
It is a pity, of course, the guys leave, suddenly turned from radar that-popret thread, but... order...
Yes, and quieter still in warehouses.

\nEvening. Something stirred beasts. Not whether someone from the radar?


  \n \n25.07.2011
\njust learned today's date... mmat! I'm just a week ago was at the barrier at the warehouse was going to come back, but here is...
In general - I am among Monolith.
I was locked in a kennel, but returned all my things (except the weapon). Even allowed to keep a diary. I'll try to remember what happened.

  \n \nThe next day, after I ordered to return to Captain Lukash, in the early morning attack began Monolith. This time they were alone, not counting the 'waves' of three dog, but a pair of wild boars, expelled from the rookery. At first, we held, and even tried to counterattack. But from behind the rocks on us hit RPG! Probably, the detachment fanatics ekzah approached.
The front edge of the Barrier, along with barbed wire just scattered explosions. The boys began to retreat in all directions. A couple of times zhahnulo near our trench. I have seen us running Matthew, as he hid in a nearby trench, then - an explosion, and when all was settled, the place was just swirling dust and pieces of glowing camouflage...
Then I broke down and ran back over the hill. I saw the downed helicopter and took off for him, but bury his breath.
And there is a Geiger counter began to crack, as if now melted - radiation! Went round the helicopter since, so an extra dose not grab it, and saw the hill people in kombezah, Monolith. Dahl turn without thinking, but suddenly noticed how the side is something translucent to me moved, but for a couple of metres 'something' was manifested in the bloodsucker!
Caught unawares, I stumbled on the slope, fell and I fell on top of the monster. I tried to shove him or reach out to the machine, but where there...
Suddenly I heard above a certain sound, like a whistle. I think so anyway, yet the controller awakened. Here bloodsucker rose sharply and angrily growling, ran away, hiding behind trees.
Above me hung four in kombezah Monolith. Then - flash in the brain, and all...

  \n \nI came to the cold, because he was lying on some boulder. Nearby visible section of concrete fence and gatehouse. Campfire Monolith sat with bowed head and rhythmically swaying. Yes, and mumbled something mournful, apparently, prayed his monolith. Then rose, and one (commander) came up to me, kicked in the ribs and jerked by the collar and forced to stand. Behind brought three more prisoners. The detachment commander fanatics loudly declared that we had the chance to serve as a monolith and thus atone for their sins. He said that as a result of a successful attack Barrier captured and will soon be eliminated as unnecessary, as servants of the Monolith will move to new lands, bringing light to all the stray. Then we were lined up in a column, and led on the road.
After some time we were ordered to stop, took the guard defense, and then from behind the rocks jumped snorks. While the fanatics were shot monsters, one of the prisoners jumped up and ran toward the red trees. When he almost ran up a huge boulder behind which the forest, a shot rang out. The commander looked Monolith (nobody but me and did not notice the escape), deposited on the ground saw the body and proudly said that, they say, our snipers are always on the alert.


  \n \n26.07.2011
\nWe are led to some kind of bunker. The commander went to talk with one-hour long wrangled, pointing at his watch, the sky, we hear the word 'radar' , 'improving' , 'Tunnel' , 'Pripyat' . He came back, said something to our protection. We drove to a hefty armored door, which had already begun to slowly swing open. Inside was a branch railway with the trucks, such as mining. We were seated in three cars, each sat down with the guard. Suddenly I felt a prick in the arm and after a few seconds to lose consciousness...

  \n \nI found myself in a dimly lit room at the foot of high, m 4, motley heap of rubbish, which was covered by several fires. Judging by the rustling of the darkness was so little space, such as the gym. I was kneeling near and saw his comrades in captivity. In the lit bonfires round out a man in a robe and hood on his head, started something monotone mumble, gradually raising his voice and changing the rhythm. On all sides of the darkness grew the roar of the crowd praying Monolith. The roar penetrated the brain, yet who quit of sleeping pills. Suddenly, the air suffused flavor, kind of like grass. I have all swam before his eyes, fires broke out and burned brighter and a lot of illuminated lights. It was a monolith.

	<text>Okay, listen, guys.
  \n \nI go, I mean on the road near the warehouses, and then again Freedom fanatics udelyvala. Chose quieter place, took the binoculars, I saw - some corpses everywhere...
I think - so, if all things are pure, then monstryaki close somewhere too quiet around. Well, I think, so help me Zone, I go down to the battlefield, and remember that Lech attendant, heard about this? said that he would go to the barrier to the free help, he charged them, something should have been, probably, and yet, he appointed me to meet here, an artifact to give. I could hear someone moaning. Kalash reloaded just in case and went to look who it is. I go up, e-my, it's Lech. Quickly bandage him where I can, but understand that it would save him for only a doctor. Then he groaned, and some time later was able to say:
  \n- Bones, go, ha, ha, hence, more alive you will, here, ha-hka...
  \n- What's here? Rest, yes dorasskazhi.
  \n- Here leech somewhere sharitsya, be careful. There he is, there, for sure. Similarly, he also shoot, shoot!
\ntwitched, then Kalash, tselyus, shoot, though in reality I only imagined it, Sidor, bastard, slipped clip idle. I think I do now. I got out PDA, trying to call Max, he here somewhere of some operations there, he could deliver a companion to the doctor. While summoned, it managed to get close sucker is very close. I turned around and saw his face, so terrible, in front of him. I manage to think that we ought to somehow escape, but the body itself in the direction rushed. Felling should urgently. From Lehoy nothing could be done. I ran, but bloodsucker runs noticeably faster than me. What's the end I came, I think. Suddenly entot monster stumbled on some piece of iron, and instead to get me in the back, managed to smash my leg only. I'm trying to crawl, but what's there. Suddenly, his face tilted up to my face, tentacles disgusting move, let alone stinks something which, words can not convey. Suddenly he begins to lurch and falls down at me, I hear the cry: 'OAG is still alive?' Of the latter, the forces trying to scream, but does not go, I say: yes, still!
Max is rushed. With the Doctor. I asked the doctor:
  \ N-What Lehoy?
  \ N-All, too late, dead Your Lech, thinking of myself!
  \ N-How dead? When?' Who? How? - Try to jump up, but falling.
  \ N-Silence, and even the second leg break.
\nshort, able to take me to the doctor, go on do not remember.
I wake up, I think it did as far as I lay there?
Suitable doctor and says: Okay, stalker. Good luck to you. In a certain sense.
  \ N-It's like that? - Ask.
  \ N-leg had to be amputated - said - Max has agreed with the screws to the one you sort of prosthesis made. Well, I think I still rotations. Then, when learned to move on this artificial leg, looked to the screw, and asked - what you say thanks? He sent me to the Lukash, boss,
and he says to me, we're saved, now work it out. Nothing in the free zone is not done.
  \n \nIn short, now I'm in the ranks of Liberty. Bloodsuckers not afraid of already learned how to kill quickly. So our boss sent me to the village to the east of the base. Now there is my outpost</text>
