		<text>Damn it - everything's so hazy...\nI remember a truck. A Death Truck. They drove for a long time. Everything hurt. The stink - I kept wanting to throw up, but there was nothing left. Then there was darkness.\nWhat happened before? I've no idea. I feel so confused...\nNow this guy called Astrologer calls me the 'Marked One'. Probably the tattoo on my arm - but I've no idea how I got it. Why would I even ask for something like this?\nMy PDA entry says that I want to kill a guy called Strelok. Is it even my PDA? Looking at the photo, I don't know who he is, or if I've even met him before.\nDamn it! It's like I'm stuck in a bad dream I can't wake up from! What should I do? Where do I go? Worst of all - who am I?\nOkay, calm down. Control. The first thing I need to do is find a guy named Sidorovich in the Rookie village. That'll be a good start...</text><!-- Changed 'Stargazer' to 'Astrologer'- Sword2012 - 31 Oct 16-->

	<string id="sl_pass_on_text">
		<text>I now have an agreement with the bridge soldiers. Safe passage through in exchange for a bottle of vodka. But only with the daytime shift as the rail guards come down at night to sleep, and they're not privy to our arrangement.\nI'll look for ways around them, especially as vodka is scarce around here. I need to watch out crossing the rails up above, too</text>

	<string id="sl_first_deep_raid_text">
		<text>I'm going on my first deep raid into the Zone. The target is the Agroprom Research Institute. I need to recover some documents from to a military expedition.\nApart from the mission, the trader gave me information about an area to the North - on the way to the Zone's center, where people's brains are supposed to 'boil'. Probably more of a tall tale than a fact, but since there's clearly something wrong with my own head I should probably should take a look at it and find out for myself. Maybe I was there before, and this is what it did to me...\nAlso, the trader told me that Strelok discovered a way to get through the area, and the traders want to know about it. Their reasons are obvious - they want to access the virgin artefact fields. Well, it looks like I'm going to help them...</text>

		<text>Well, I got some fresh air and experienced the local wildlife. Interestingly, I seem to remember some of it already, but it's all blurry.\nI got a chance to try out the local 'amusements', otherwise known as anomalies...\nJudging by the fact that I survived them, I've probably come across them before, but my brain refuses to remember...\nSidorovich is one clever bastard - he knows he can use me almost for free, and that's exactly what he intends to do. But maybe, even inadvertently, he'll help me find this Strelok.\nBut why do I need to kill him? He's the only connection I have to my past...</text>

	<string id="sl_fox_meet_text">
		<text>I met up with Fox. It's that good-news, bad-news scenario. The bad is that he knows very little about Strelok. The good is that his brother Seriy may know more. It seems Seriy is at a hangar about two kilometers north of here, in some radioactive waste dump. Sounds like the last place on earth I'd want to go to, but I need to get there before he moves on...</text>

	<string id="sl_monolith_off_text">
		<text>I'm only a step away from the ones who created this network of deadly psi-transmitters all over the Zone. The Monolith is just another zombifier, it seems, with the exception that someone intentionally created a hologram in the shape of a huge crystal inside the Sarcophagus. When even the bravest adventurers approach it, it messes with their brains. Maybe even makes them believe that their wishes have come true.\nHave I been affected by this thing before? I'm not sure, but I'm going to get answers from whoever's behind it. They've even invited me in. Well, here I come, you bastards!</text>

		<text>A bit of local folklore I picked up - legend has it that there's a wish-granting machine deep inside the Zone.\nThe exact location is unknown, but it's somewhere in the center.\nApparently, all you need to do is get to it, then make your wish. So how about finding it and saying "I want to remember everything about my past!"\nThen again, I wouldn't want to waste a wish. And what if I remembered everything, and it turns out I've been a complete bastard?\nI wonder how many wishes it grants...</text>
