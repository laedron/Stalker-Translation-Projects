    <text>This amazing device allows you to detect at a distance of 50 meters many life forms, either warm-blooded or cold-blooded. The principles of its operation are described in detail in the published works of Professor Bolshakov, 'Practical applications of the unique properties of artifact ZX-232 - 'Crystal Ball' as known in the field. And also in the thesis by assistant Semenov - 'Biological organisms as natural radio transceivers'. A brief explanation of the operation of this device can be as so: the majority of living organisms emit, while moving, electromagnetic waves that are trackable, and measure their frequency, intensity and determine their position in space. When working muscles but also the nerve fiber to muscle bundle receives electrical impulses, and the living tissue, as well as the tissue in which the conduction current are stored microtransmitter. Quite a long time it was thought that due to the extreme weakness of the signals to pinpoint their position was only possible only under laboratory conditions, using bulky amplifying equipment - according to this principle the so-called 'auroskopy', devices that hold around a living body to an 'aura', which is on essentially electromagnetic radiation a certain range. During the study the various artifacts Zone scientists came upon a very interesting effect of one of the subjects - an artifact called 'Crystal Ball'. With a small handheld radio assistant Semenova unexpectedly began to receive a signal of a private radio station, located in one of the provincial areas of Argentina.
    Having studied the unusual phenomenon, the collective scientific camps came to the only plausible explanation - an artifact of the 'Crystal Ball' amplifies and filters the noise from the radio ordered. Obviously, the microscopic part of the Argentine radio receiving a signal present at the location of the camp, but was so small that no powerful receivers have not been able to fix it. However, it was worth only bring a console connection to a stationary camp 'Crystal Ball', as the noise from the air began to be heard hundreds of voices in the further setting up successfully filtered out and caught almost all the signals available on a range of remote communication transmitters, the most distant of which was at a distance of 14 thousands of miles! To develop the project 'Crystal interception immediately imposed a stamp 'top secret', but until that time, some devices made with such amazing properties, yet the public domain. The device 'bioradar Peleng radiation of living tissues of organisms measures their frequency and distance. As a result, conventional liquid crystal display you can see the marks that indicate living organisms. Since the unit was created primarily for exploration in the Zone, an assistant Semenov uploaded to the database device information about the frequencies most often emitted by members of the local fauna. Unfortunately, the organisms in the Zone quickly mutate, in a few weeks a list of frequencies had to be updated. However, the resourceful stalkers among the first users of the device, invented a simple, though barbaric way, to get a bearing on the mutants - if the product is installed, the best on the belt, put a sample of biological tissue of the monster types you want to pinpoint - the device will automatically reset, and mutants of the desired type will be displayed on the small screen. It is true that recently there have been some new varieties of mutants that can not detect with this instrument. The disadvantage of the device is its high cost.</text>
