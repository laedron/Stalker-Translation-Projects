    <text>Thank you Strelok for helping. It was a tough fight. We can now rest. If you go further you will find what you are looking for. So go back to the transition and go right then you get to the Bus Station. But there the ground is open and very insecure. If you go through the same area then you will be in front of the hotel and to the right is the 'Monolith' base. Those guys are without a roof because they are located in the stadium. They planned to make their way through it to get to the station. That's it.</text>
