Developed for special units in the Russian army. Shock resistant and water resistant. Withstands immersion up to 300 meters. Equipped with a timer and stopwatch. New units were repeatedly stolen away by a military scout from the special forces warehouse Bibik (D-3) and sold to wholesale dealers in the Area.
