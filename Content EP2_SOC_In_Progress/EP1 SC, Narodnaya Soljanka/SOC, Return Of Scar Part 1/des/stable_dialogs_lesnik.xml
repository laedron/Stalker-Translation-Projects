			<text>Hallo.. sendest du das SOS Signal?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_1">
			<text>Nein, das ist der Controller beim Bauernhof. Sei Vorsichtig. Der versucht auf diese Art und Weise seine Opfer anzulocken. ...und bist du?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_2">
			<text>Scar. Der Wissenschaftler in Kordon hatte dieses Signal aufgefangen und bat mich das zu überprüfen. Sag mal kannst du mir was über diese Gruppe "Masters" erzählen und wiso bist du hier?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_3">
			<text>Der Wissenschaftler in Kordon? Das ist interessant! Ich hatte als Techniker im Labor X-8 gearbeitet. Diese liegt im Norden der Zone. Musste es aber verlassen. Ich arbeitete mit zwei anderen Kollegen zusammen und wir studierten einen neuen Mutanten Typ. Wir hatten einen seltsamen Zombie in Pripyat gefunden, dieser war halb durchsichtig. So ähnlich als würde man auf die Wasser Oberfläche schauen kann bis zum Grund nur Trübe sehen. So musst du dir das vorstellen und statt Blut hatte dieser auch Säure. Die wollten wir noch untersuchten. Jedenfalls..., meine Kollegen gingen ins Nebenzimmer und wollten was erledigen. Ich arbeitet an den 5 Mini Antennen, worauf ich Schritte hörte. Erst dachte ich das wären meine Kollegen. Als ich mich umdrehte waren die aber nicht da. Stattdessen hörte ich was Merkwürdiges. Ich holte die Waffe schnell aus der Schublade und zielte Richtung Tür. Dann hörte ich eine Stimme... "Lass uns los". Als nächstes hörte ich ein Radio. Erst dachte ich... "es gibt ja viele Wunder in der Zone aber Geister... UFO's ... Nein ..., das Akzeptiere ich nicht". Dann hörte ich eine weitere Stimme. "Ey, Chef. Was sollen wir mit dem anderen machen. Der könnte noch nützlich sein. Die beiden hier sind Geschichte." Ich dachte, ich muss hier schnell weg. Im Labor waren die wichtigen Türen mit Elektronischen Schlössern ausgestattet. Ich lief in einem Nebenraum und programmierte schnell den Tür Code um. Diese Tür hatte mich erstmal gerettet. Ich schlich weiter zum einem Verbindungs Tunnel. Dieser Führt vom X-8 Labor in das X-18 Labor. Den Tür Code änderte ich auch dort ab. Dennoch schnappte Borov und seine Banditen Bande mich. Sie hielten mich in einem Keller gefangen. Dann tauchte dieser Lebedev auf.  Die hatten mich an ihn Übergeben. Erst gestern entkam ich Lebedev mithilfe des Artefaktes "Black  Hole". Dieses Teleportierte mich dann schließlich hier her. Vorher hatte noch mit Lebedev geredet und erfuhr was über diese Geistehafte Gruppe.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_4">
			<text>Ach... du warst in der Basis von Lebedev... Clear Sky? Die kenn ich. Ich wurde aber  damals immer mit verschlossen Augen rein und rausgeführt. Das ging mir richtig auf'n Piss. Du musst mir helfen... Ich muss dorthin, und du weißt wie man dahin kommt.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_5">
			<text>Scar... du willst da tatsächlich da rein? Willst du sterben? Denn dort sind überall Wachen aufgestellt. Warum willst du nur dorthin.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_6">
			<text>Sicher nicht um in Nostalgischen Erinnerungen zu schwelgen. Hilf mir Kostya! Ich muss in die Clear Sky Basis und dann zurück nach Kordon.  Ich habe keine Ahnung wo man diese "Übergänge" findet. Du schon. Hilfst du mir?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya_dialog_7">
			<text>Ja, Okay, wenn wir die Ruinen im Südwesten erricht haben trennen sich unsere wege. Denn Ich muss zur Pump-Station.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_svalil_dialog_0">
			<text>Hey.. Sag mal.. wo ist Sidorovitsch?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_svalil_dialog_1">
			<text>Fuck nochmals ... Keine Ahnung. Er verkaufte uns seinen Bunker und die Tür wollte er aber unbedingt selber behalten. Also bauten wir die aus. Gastello kam mit einem Hubschrauber und holte ihn ab. Warum... Wieso… Weshalb? Sagte er nicht.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_svalil_dialog_2">
			<text>Hmm.. ich wette der hat wohl was Wertvolles gefunden. Dieser alte Geizkragen... Davon hatte er ja schon immer gesprochen das er irgendwann weg will.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_svalil_dialog_3">
			<text>Ja, schon seltsam, das er es aufeinmal so dringend hatte wegzukommen. Das er  sich in seinem Alter nochmal auf Achse macht. Normalerweise wärmt er sich ein paar Brötchen auf und schaut den ganzen Tag Fern und geht seinen Geschäften nach.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_ataka_gastello_dialog_0">
			<text>Alles klar! Der Übergang zur "Müllhalde" ist offen. nun liegt es an dir.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_ataka_gastello_dialog_1">
			<text>Sehr gut! ... Scar?... Warte. Warte noch ein Moment. ich erhalte gerade über Funk eine Warnung das dort eine Mutanten Welle, aus dem Tal im Nordosten, anrollt.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_ataka_gastello_dialog_2">
			<text>Du hat ein Fungerät und sagts nichts? Erzähl mir jetzt nicht das der Betrunkene Gastello geanwortet hat und den Hubschrauber fliegt?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_ataka_gastello_dialog_3">
			<text>Ja, schon aber.... wenn er zu betrunken ist könntest du nicht übernehmen? Nachdem du die Mutanten erledigt hast komm zu mir zurück und besprechen wie man nach X-18 kommt.  Ich werde schon mal in die Nähe von X-18 gehen, ins Dunkle Tal. Dort besprechen wir alles Weitere. Wenn du mich dort nicht antriffst versuch es in der Bar. Kannst auch Kostya fragen, der bekommt auch so ziemlich alles mit.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_ataka_gastello_dialog_4">
			<text>Leave it to me I'm an expert and if all is successful I'll have aerial fire for the mutants that are in the northeast. After a good cleaning bandits too I'll head to the base near the entrance to X-18. See you there.\n\n</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_ataka_gastello_dialog_5">
			<text>%c[255,255,128,1]Okay, Lass es mit Gastello. Ruf ihn nicht. Der ist betrunken wie ein Penner. Wir müssen sofort zum Labor X-18 und dann zu Borov's Ort. Wir müssen los..., bewegung!</text>

		<string id="dimak_poehali_bolota_0">
			<text>Nun Dimak, wie ist deine Stimmung?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dimak_poehali_bolota_1">
			<text>Sehr gut Scar.... Ja, und vielen Dank für deine Hilfe. Die Wissenschaftler brauchen uns nicht mehr. Wenn du irgendwann mal in der Nähe des Forschung Instituts Agroprom bist. Schau doch mal bei unserm Waffenmeister vorbei. Er Repariert Rüstungen, Schutz Anzüge, Waffen etc... Er macht einen sehr guten Job. Sein Name ist "Loser". Sprich mit ihm. Er ist der Jack-der-Händler und kennt verdammt viele Geheimnisse. Ich gib dir die Koordinaten und den "Übergang" vom AKW in Richtung Pripyat. So nebenbei... Kannst du einen Hubschrauber fliegen?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dimak_poehali_bolota_2">
			<text>Äh... Jetzt ... spontan... Also... wenn ich es muss ..dann.. kann ich einen Fliegen. Warum?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dimak_poehali_bolota_3">
			<text>Das hört sich nicht überzeugend an... aber besser als nichts. Wir hatten unseren alten Freund Gastello gebeten uns zurück in den Norden zu fliegen. Leider ist er die meiste Zeit betrunken.... und ich glaube nicht das er in so einer Verfassung ein Spitzen Piloten ab gibt. Also... Wenn es hart auf hart kommt, musst du den Vogel Übernehmen. Sobald der Hubscharuber da ist und wir an Bord gehen wollen bleib in unserer Nähe. Du musst den Vogel dann einfach Richtung Norden Fliegen. Halte Ausschau nach einem Auto. Einen weißen Niva. Dieser Parkt auf einem Hügel. Sobald wir da sind wird der Sink-Modus Automatisch eingeleitet. Nun, was meinst du?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dimak_poehali_bolota_4">
			<text>Das lässt sich einrichten.... Ich muss sowieso in diese Richtung. Muss mit Vororin sprechen und nebenbei stehe ich doch noch irgendwie in deiner Schuld wegen dem "Übergangs Aktivator" und der Info mit dem Waffenmeister. Nagut.... wie Gastello immer im Rausch singt... "come fly with me, let' s fly, let 's fly away" nur ohne den Alkohol.</text>

			<text>Commander I come with grave news.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog_1">
			<text>And you did not get killed by the mercenary helicopters... that is frankly amazing. What is your news?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog_2">
			<text>At the request of scientists from Cordon I am here because their radio does not yet have full range. I have come to warn you that mercenaries plan to attack. A soldier was sent to the checkpoint with a note.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog_3">
			<text>Okay, well our radio was repaired. The soldier they sent fell into the hands of a bloodsucker, but we found a note on his body. So thanks for bringing the news but we are already waiting for them, they are due any minute now. Quite brazen is their leader Cygnus. We managed to communicate with the scientists in Cordon and they informed us about your visit. They say that you are not a novice stalker and if you help I'll throw in an advance in the form of bullets and a 'rucksack', and I'll put a marker to Cordon on your PDA. A good deal?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog_4">
			<text>I see you are an expert in recruiting! Okay, I'll help.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_x10_dialog_0">
			<text>Here's your disc Professor. It was not easy, but now the 'Masters' no longer control the 'Scorcher'.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_x10_dialog_1">
			<text>This is amazing, I never thought I'd see my disc again. Here you go, some money and a couple of recipes. I received a message from the 'Masters'. They promised to return the head of my wife if I delivered you. But I trust you, I know that you will do the impossible. It is a very pleasant and much quieter place than Yantar. I had thought to move into the bunker of the previous owner, but without the door it was less safe. But this place agrees with me perfectly, and I can trade and make repairs from here. Oh, I almost forgot, I called General Voronin and reported that you asked about stalkers from the Oleg Tango group, and after some confusion everyone is meeting in Wolf's Lair. Well, at least I think that's what was said.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_x10_dialog_2">
			<text>Yes I think here is safer than the bunker without doors in Yantar... err, Amber. Anyway I am sure you will eventually settle down here. Dimon, as I understand went in search for his father in Wolf's Lair. What a holiday that should be. Thanks for everything professor.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog1_0">
			<text>Damn, that was tough! They were a mixed group, the mercenaries had with them a new dangerous group called the 'Masters'!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog1_1">
			<text>Yeah they were equipped with excellent armour. You helped save a lot of soldiers today stalker, I thank you. For your help I'll give you some more ammo, and a watch... to be honest I can't make it work, maybe you'll have more luck. It has menus, and you can set the timer for a time to discharge, and as well for the treatment of health and energy.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog1_2">
			<text>Your welcome. About the transition you mentioned, back to Cordon.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog1_3">
			<text>Pay attention, this is important... Lebedev is in Agroprom somewhere, maybe you can talk with him, he was seen due south of this building sometimes. If he won't share, shoot him and look for his PDA... that will open the transition for sure!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebed_dialog1_4">
			<text>So, shoot Lebedev and getting his PDA that will open the route to Cordon. Gotcha!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog_0">
			<text>I hear the military fixed their radio. It's a good thing I was there in Agroprom, as Lebedev attacked the complex with his 'friends', and I had to help the soldiers. I spoke to Lebedev, and he has threatened to attack Cordon and kill all the scientists. Oddly when I shot him he vanished. Poof! Wtf?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog_1">
			<text>I'm just glad you survived, really. I know about the ability of Lebedev. Kostya told me how you took the absolutes from the base. Anyway we need your help again. We have heard that a sniper is coming to kill us, sent by Lebedev.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog_2">
			<text>You all need to hide, particularly Vasilina with her pert buns and...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog_3">
			<text>NO! Vasilina explained that if we all hide the sniper will know something is wrong. At the military base lies an enhanced SVD. In a rucksack in one of the trees. It's the best rifle in the Zone, as it has target tracking built in. If you get on the roof of the barracks building in the southern military base you should see the rucksack. Hopefully that information is correct. Bring it back and we can talk more.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog_4">
			<text>Ok, so I head south to the military base to find an enhanced SVD. I need to get on the roof to see the rucksack which is in a tree. Easy as cake!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog_5">
			<text>Excellent Scar. Just be careful, and then come back and we can talk again.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog1_0">
			<text>I found the SVD. It's in great shape. I agree it may well be the best gun in the Zone, as it has autolock built into its sight.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog1_1">
			<text>I hate to say I told you so. Oh, wait, I did. lol.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog1_2">
			<text>Okay, I forgive you. So who will I shoot?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog1_3">
			<text>Who? I have no idea, just some paid sniper. I suggest you take a position on the roof of the building next to us, climb up high, onto the chimney, used the truck's engine cover to jump up to the roof. I think there will be three SMS before the sniper arrives. Use the scope SVD 'Tiger' to track him. He will come from the north-west side. Take him out!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog1_4">
			<text>I am afraid of heights. I never wanted to be a chimney sweep.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sniper_dialog1_5">
			<text>Quit bitch'n and get up on the roof before more of us get killed.</text>

			<text>Der Abend gestern in der Bar hat mehr als nur gerockt. Die Anarchisten  kamen gestern zu besuch und randalierten. Victor konnte sie soweit vermöbeln. Aber nun anstatt zu Schlafen bewacht er das Lager und das ganze Geld was wir für die Stalker bereitstellen. Spricht mit Airborne. Er hat den Kürzen gezogen. Er wurde, als Wache, verdonnert mit dem MG die ganze Zeit auf irgendwelche Felsen schauen. Der ist richtig angepisst und redet kein Wort mit uns. Scar? ... Sprich mit ihm ... lerne ihn kennen.

			<text>Zhora said that on the far side of the forest he fired on two helicopters which means they are here. I guess Airborne is giving our money to them. Airborne will probably fly on one of those choppers. We need to attack them and capture a helicopter. You can fly that helicoper. This is the only chance to catch up with Airborne. I know the transition to East Pripyat, but it's a long trip as a walking group, so a helicopter is mandatory. You need to find a PDA too. This will be a long trip.</text>

		<string id="vdv_dostat_2">
			<text>Then decide who will attack the military stalkers? Someone has to stay in the camp.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_dostat_3">
			<text>Ah shit we do not know where the pilot Gastro is! Well we'll gather around the campfire and decide who does what, but I think you will go with six or seven guys looking for the helicopter, and the others will remain here. Once controlling the helicopter a transition will be available in the north to go to East Pripyat. There we'll get our hands on Airborne and his PDA.</text>

		<string id="prishli_s_up_1">
			<text>Wow you guys are amazng! Where are the rest of the guys? Come on and rest a while. When all are gathered we'll open the case.</text>

		<string id="keys_goni_0">
			<text>Well well well, look who we have here! Give us the case and release my friends otherwise do not expect any mercy. Dimon and Torych, blah blah blah...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_goni_1">
			<text>Dimon and Torych caught me before I could trap them. Scar, Dimon, Torych listen I have enough money for you all, your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I suggest that we split up the money and you let me go. And Dimon, well, let your father die in the trap. If they are released no one will forgive me and you'll be dancing on my grave.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_goni_2">
			<text>So you suggest that Dimon lets his own father fry in the anomaly, and we leave our friends behind. I say no to your conditions. Tell me about the trap anomoly now!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_goni_3">
			<text>Ok, ok, Dimak and your friends are 30 meters from here. Go out the gate, turn left, jump down to the lower level. There are two metal garages, they are in one of them. But they are trapped behind an anomoly. So I say let me take the case 20 meters and then I will set the timer. You will have 5 minutes to find the deactivator. It will be in a white case somewhere here in the yard.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_goni_4">
			<text>Your not going anywhere! How about you don't walk 20 meters, and you leave the case, and you disable the trap. Or I shoot you in the face. \n\n</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_goni_5">
			<text>%c[255,255,128,1]Up yours! We will figure out how to disable the trap ourselves, and get the case with the deactivator. And then I will shoot you in the face.</text>

		<string id="dryka_svoy_dialog_0">
			<text>Why did you come here? Are you the one who shot down the helicopter?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dryka_svoy_dialog_1">
			<text>To help out and I only found you by accident. I had gotten here a week ago. We were heading to the transition to East Pripyat. The transition collapsed after a powerful explosion. Someone set off a strong mine and some of our guys died. We were 16 people and now only 10 are left. We went to the Yanov railway station and ran into military stalkers. They were like cockroaches all over the place, and we ran into more traps, and we had to eat disgusting rare animals. I met up with Oleg by chance and he explained the situation. He wanted me to shoot down the helicopter. He said he would give me 25% of there money to do that. Then later he would not give me the money. I bitched and then they started to gang up on me, and luckily some military stalkers appeared and started shooting at us. I ran like the wind. Now I do not know were to go. If Oleg and his group leave I will be happy. Gastello's callsign was heard recently too. He apparently is not drunk.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dryka_svoy_dialog_2">
			<text>Well I think most of our problems are over now. Oleg I think should be pleased, after all, if it were not for Oleg then Navy would have gotten away and he would be miles from here.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dryka_svoy_dialog_3">
			<text>Even if Gastello flies this thing I'm afraid the helicopter will not cope with 9 people. The whole thing is damaged from salt, too many flight-hours, little servicing and radiation.</text>

			<text>Unlucky for you and me Scar, they've just arrived.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bratva_prishla_2">

		<string id="bratva_prishla_3">
			<text>You know, if you were cuter, younger, had a good body, and didn't smoke, drink and smell bad and... well, if I wasn't a lesbian and obsessed with dildos, then maybe I wouldn't find you completely repulsive. Oh, and life's a bitch, so what are you going to do about it?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_ok_0">
			<text>Hey Oleg I have the case with me, take it. Airborne had access to explosives on him and when he was shot he exploded. lol!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_ok_1">
			<text>That's good. Is everything intact?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_ok_2">
			<text>Yes, even Gastello is back. He has nowhere to go now that his helicopter is trashed. As you know he helped us get out of Jupiter, but the crash into that large swamp save our lives. Softer than concrete!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_ok_3">
			<text>Yea, we heard an explosion. Here as promised is a half million rubles and also two of Airborne's caches. The contents are yours. I think you will be happy. One cache is under the boulders where Airborne used to stand guard, and the second cache is on a branch of a dead tree near our camp slightly up a hill.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_ok_4">
			<text>Wow thanks Oleg!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_proval_0">
			<text>Here's the case, take it. Know that Airborne was rigged with explosives and is now in a million pieces.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_proval_1">
			<text>That's good. Is everything else okay?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_proval_2">
			<text>Unfortunately six members were killed before I could turn off the trap with a timer. We had nowhere to go. Then Gastello helped us get out of Jupiter, but the chopper could not stand the strain, because of his old age I guess. And we crashed in the large swamp. We are lucky to have survived.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_proval_3">
			<text>Yea we heard an explosion. It's really bad losing some of our guys. We are all happy to have gotten our money back. Keep a little money as a reward. Okay, for the lose of their souls we drink, and in memory of Dimak and the others.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="keys_prines_proval_4">
			<text>Okay, let us remember them! [gulp gulp]</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gastello_dialog_0">
			<text>Wow, nice crash! Are you still learning to fly or practicing crashing?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gastello_dialog_1">
			<text>Fuck you... only a great pilot would have got us down in a swamp in one piece. If we'd crashed anywhere else onto something hard we would all be dead. You my friend would also be dead!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gastello_dialog_2">
			<text>Okay, okay, yeah I guess you're right. Sorry! I guess airworthy helicopters are rare in the zone.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gastello_dialog_3">
			<text>Well I need another way out of here now that the chopper is trashed. I need you to help me get to the Oleg's camp. I'm really shaken up. I can't focus or anything... help me, you owe me!</text>

			<text>Das ist wirklich Unglaublich! Vasilina hat es schon angekündigt das du aus dem Koma erwacht bist. Sie hatte dich, die ganze Zeit über, gepflegt. Oh.. Entschuldige, ich bin Igor Misiulia. Wissenschaftler.  Wir dachten, du würdest sterben. Denn, ...du musst wissen..., als wir dich gefunden hatten warst du in einem Fürchterlichen zustand. Du lagst da schon so lange, dass alle deine Klamotten mit der Zeit vor sich hin rottenden. Du scheinst wohl eine außergewöhnliche Fähigkeit entwickelt zu haben, das du da draußen nicht gestorben bist. Aber sag mal .. die Narbe in deinem Gesicht...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_1">
			<text>Hm.. die.. ja die habe ich schon lange. Die hab ich mir zugezogen als ich mal eine paar Wissenschaftler eskortiert hatte und wir dabei von einer Emission überrascht wurden... ...man.. dröhnt mir der Schädel.. Kannst mich Scar nennen... Was für ein merkwürdiger Haufen hier? Was sind das für Stalker?... oh, mein Kopf ... das hämmert.... Mich gefunden? Wie bin ich den hier nach Kordon gekommen?  .. und ... wo ist Lebedev und Strelok?.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_2">
			<text>Das mit dem Kopf, das wird wieder. Vasilina meint, so in einer Stunde gibt sich das. Dann werde ich dir mal ein Update geben was du so in den ... nicht erschrecken .. 2 Jahren verpasst hast. .. Während ich dein PDA aktualisiert hatte sind mir die Militärischen Geheim Dokumente sowie deine Persönlichen Notizen aufgefallen. Da ging es.. wohl um ein Söldner namens Strelok. Du, Lebedev und seiner Friedfertigen Gruppe Clear Sky, ihr wart ihm ja ziemlich auf der Spur.. dann die sache mit dem Hinterhalt im Roten Wald, bis hin zum AKW, ins Zentrum der Zone. Du hattest damals schon einige Emissionen überlebt. Nun... Was aus Strelok geworden ist keine Ahnung. Soviel ich weiß hatte Lebedev Wochen damit verbracht Strelok's Leiche zu finden. Aber das war vor 2 jahren. Lebedev ist total runtergekommen, ein miserabler Koch und Säufer. Die meiste Zeit nur betrunken. Dein PDA hab ich Aktualisiert und eine neue Firmware draufgespielt. Der war wirklich in einen schlechten Zustand. Oh ... und diese Bilder... sind verlorengegangen. Du weißt welche ich meine.  Nochmal wegen Lebedev. Nicht nur das der ein Säufer ist, der hat auch die Seiten gewechselt. Ich habe keine Ahnung was damals mit dem Mann passiert ist. Heutzutage versorgt er Fraktionen mit Informationen und Forschung‘s Berichte. Diese Gruppen hätte er damals nicht mal in sein Sumpf gelassen.  Übrigens gibt es eine neue Gruppe. Sie nennt sich "Masters", eine Fraktion die die Zone für sich beansprucht, ein wirklich übler Haufen und eine Gruppe "Witches"... und ja.. das ist kein Traum.. es gibt hier in der Zone doch tatsächlich eine Frauenbewegung. Du siehst.. nicht alles ist nur schlechter geworden, im Gegenteil. Die Schönste Sache der Welt haben wir nun auch in der Zone .... hm.. ja.. Ich komme vom Thema ab.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_3">
			<text>So.. kannst du mir erzählen ob Strelok noch am Leben ist? .. warte mal .. 2 Jahre,  .. 2 Jahre war ich im Koma und lebe noch..? Moment... Frauen .. seit wann gibt es denn Frauen hier in der Zone? ... Wow!..</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_4">
			<text>Tja, zwischen all den ganzen Mutanten und Emissionen bist du noch am Leben. Als wir die Daten in deinem PDA eingesehen hatten fragten wir also rum. Den sowas ähnliches hatte es schon mal gegeben. Ach.. zum Haufen ... nimm es den Stalker'n hier nicht übel das die dich mit Argwohn empfangen. Seit dem Strelok aus dem "Totenlaster" geborgen wurde sind die Jungs vorsichtig geworden. Die Geschichte um Strelok ist sowieso mehr als fragwürdig. Er hatte irgendwie mit dem Projekt "Bewusstsein Kontrolle" zutun. Dann wollte er sich ..irgendwie.. selbst töten... jedenfalls hatte er sich irgendwann gefangen. Manche reden von einem Gedächnisverlust. Anscheinend konnte er sich erinnern und half sehr vielen Fraktionen sowie meine damaligen Kollegen.  Er hatte auch mit der Abschaltung des "Hirn Schmelzers" zu tun und verdiente sich so jedenfalls den Respekt vieler Gruppen und Fraktionen. Er stoppte mit seinen Freunden auch das Projekt "Bewusstseinskontrolle" und so eröffneten sich sehr viele Gebiete für uns.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_5">
			<text>Wow! Das ist .. eine Menge! Verdammt und das alles habe ich verschlafen. So ein Dreck... . Hör zu Igor! Ich muss Kontakt zu meiner Kranken Tochter aufnehmen. Gibt es eine Möglichkeit das ich sie Anrufen kann oder eine Nachricht zukommen lassen könnte. Ein Freund pflegt und passt auf sie auf. Ich muss mich da melden. Die machen sich sicherlich schon sorgen und die ist wirklich schwer Krank und dann muss noch Lebedev aufsuchen. hmm....mir ist noch ein bisschen schummrig...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_6">
			<text>Das ist schlecht und tut mir leid. Wir müssten auch unsere Leute Kontaktieren. Aber im Moment haben wir keinen voll Funktionsfähigen Sender der sich mit dem Satelliten verbinden kann. Den Transmitter den wir hier haben, der kommt nicht über 40km.  Das Netzwerk erreicht gerade mal 10 Kilometer.  Senden und empfangen ist also dementsprechend schlecht. Okay, die kurz Version ...Wir sind hier in der Zone gestrandet... Wir kamen zusammen mit dem Militär um ein paar Generatoren aufzubauen. Die sollten die Übergänge offenhalten und gleichzeitig die Zone stabilisieren. Doch dann kamen auch neue Gruppen und Fraktionen aus der Außenwelt. Es gab so oft Fraktion‘s Kriege das es schier unmöglich war die Generatoren einzurichten.  Nachdem alles versagt hatte kamen wir auch nicht mehr in die Außenbezirke und wurde von den Standorten abgeschnitten. Wir mussten uns zurückziehen und konnten so die Zone nicht mehr verlassen. Wir waren also gezwungen die Übergänge die wir eingerichtet hatten wieder zu Verschließen und zu Tarnen. Mir war klar das ich mit dieser Maßnahme uns eine "Gefangenschaft" eingebrockt habe aber als ehemaliges Mitglied vom Militär bin ich überzeugt das dieser Ort zurzeit am sichersten ist. Wir sind nur noch ein paar überlebende. Mit dem Militär an den Checkpoint's brauch man gar nicht reden, die selbst wurden von der Armee und den Behörden in der Außenwelt Im Stich gelassen. Scar? Wir haben doch das gleiche Ziel, lass uns zusammenarbeiten. Es gibt eine Möglichkeit diesen Transmitter hier zu Reparieren. Dazu müssten wir den Übergang zur "Müllhalde" nehmen. Dort gibt es einen Transmitter auf einem Radioaktiven Müllberg. Dieser grenzt an einem Wald und liegt in der Nähe von einem Sumpf. Das letzte mal als wir es versucht hatten, schossen irrsinnige Typen auf uns. Wir mussten erstmal die Flucht ergreifen. Bringe den Transmitter hierher und Vasilina wird den Sender Reparieren und verstärken. Damit du siehst das es uns ernst ist gebe ich dir Ich ein seltenes Artefakt... Eine Waffe und Munition benötigst du auch. Sprich mal mit Dimon. Der sitzt am Lagerfeuer. Er war es, der dich hierhergebracht hatte. Er ist auf der Suche nach seinem Vater. Wäre gut, wenn ihr zusammenarbeitet. Er hat übrigens den "Übergangs Aktivator" um zur Müllhalde. Waffen und anderes zeug bekommst du bei Sidorovitch. Er ist der Örtliche Händler hier ... und ein wenig seltsam. Ihn vertrauen hier aber alle. </text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_7">
			<text>Ach du schei... Sidorovich! Stimmt ja, .. der Typ ist so ein Arsch mitunter. Ein echter Geizkragen. Selbst nach 2 Jahren Schlaf kann man den nicht vergessen. Ok...  Ich werde mit Dimon und dann mit Sidorovitsch reden und dann holen wir den beschädigten Sender.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_8">
			<text>Was...echt ... Toll!  Sobald du bei der Müllhalde angekommen bist, sei äußerst vorsichtig. Sehr viele Banditen und Mutanten hausen da und Schießen auf alles was sich bewegt... Hier ist noch der "Übergangs Aktivator" zum Sumpf. Versuch eine Tasche mit Seltenen Artefakte zu finden. Ach... und versuche Kostya zu finden. Der könnte behilflich sein. Bringe die Artefakte zu uns, den Sender gibst du Vasilina. Hier das Artefakt... nur geliehen, ich will es wiederhaben. Also nicht verkaufen.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_dialog_shram_9">
			<text>Nagut.. ,nach 2 Jahren kann ich wohl ein bisschen frische Luft vertragen. Ich gehe zu Dimon und werde dann Sidorovitsch mal 'Hallo' sagen.</text>

		<string id="esc_dima_dialog_0">
			<text>Hi Dimon. Danke, dass du mich hierhergebracht hast. Igor erzählte mir das du auch auf einer Mission bist?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_dima_dialog_1">
			<text>Na!.. Nachrichten verbreiten sich hier ja schnell. Ja das stimmt. Ich bin auf der Suche nach meinem Vater und hoffe ihn sehr bald zu finden. Man sagte mir er wäre Richtung Zentrum gegangen. Sicher bin ich mir da aber nicht. Er ist eigentlich nicht der Typ für solche Sachen und dann soll er sich den "Masters“ angeschlossen haben?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_dima_dialog_2">
			<text>Lass uns zusammenarbeiten. Igor sagte mir das du den Übergangs Aktivator, der zur Müllhalde führt, bei dir hast um den beschädigten Sender zu holen?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_dima_dialog_3">
			<text>Sicher. Das machen wir und bergen den Sender. Der soll sich ja dort aufhalten. Ich hatte es letztes Mal versucht. Da war aber Zuviel Strahlung so dass ich abbrechen musste. Du solltest dir vorher aber eine Waffe besorgen. Ich ließ vorübergehend meine Toz bei Sidorovich. Was die Munition angeht... da musst du mit ihm verhandeln. Kann sein das er vorher noch was dafür erledigt haben will. Er ist ziemlich gierig. Ach.. seine Tür ist abgesperrt. Es dauert ein bisschen bis er sich meldet. Aber wenn er sich meldet, dann ist das schon mal ein gutes Zeichen. Man kann mit ihm reden. Sobald du alles hast können wir los.</text>

While Vasilina will repair and adjust the antenna, will you bring them to the camp? Solvador is very dear to me. I would give you my 'Thunderstorm', but I only have 10 rounds of ammo.

And Hog, what does he give you, nothing except an extra piece of butter on some bread. Just remember Voronin has snipers that do not miss. Also the fact that Duty and Freedom have a truce, you must know even in your Dark Valley you do not know about the new and dangerous enemies, the 'Masters', which may find you at any time before you and your Hog can prepare.

			<text>Hello Scar, long time no see... 'he-he'... 'no see', get it?! Well, whatever. While you were sleeping, as you say, for two years, the science which is now under the rule of  the 'Masters' invented a new type of camouflage outfit. As you cannot see, which I am wearing. Now wait until 8pm, and I can give you more detailed instructions about Borov. You can take a nap if you like, but it is better that you don't go anywhere to far away.</text>

		<string id="dark_pulja_dialog_3">
			<text>It's not easy, my friend, you by now have seen the snipers in the towers? Well RPGs hurt, and though we are far away, from their PDA, they can see us, and they have no hesitation on silencing the living individual. Ok, now to business. The crossbow arrows are bloody useless from any distance, only real snipers know the right weapons to bring. To hit Hog you need to go a bit north and although there's no mark on your map I've marked the ground with an army med-kit. About 20:00 Hog goes onto a roof easily visible from that point. So shoot him from that point. Yes, even after a successful or unsuccessful shot immediately depart south towards the Cordon, from whence you came. In the mean time I will open a transition point, so keep an eye on the PDA for that location, a transition to Wolf's Lair.</text>

			<text>Voronin! What, like I care?! Voronin is an arse. To hell with him and you... splat punks both of you! Oh, and if you know Voronin then you need to check for lice. Anyway the crossbow is lost in the wetlands, in a swamp in the south west of Wolf's Lair, set in a deep ravine, so you will have to go for a swim to find it. I'll mark the area on your PDA. I also lost a pack of arrows near three huge boulders, just above the swamp, when a giant mutant appeared. I barely had the chance to run. So if you want it... well, you can go get it... you ass. Oh and if you want the transition to Hog, kill the mutant for me. Ah what the hell, follow me and I'll take you to the three huge boulders.</text>

			<text>Aaah, just get lost you punk, I wonder if anyone likes you. You've got the crossbow and the arrows I lost. Well I hope they get you killed. I don't like Hog any more than the next man, but I prefer him to you. If I didn't think Voronin would send me early to heaven, I'd kill you myself. As it is, I'll give you the transition to Dark Valley, and of course Hog. May he kill you slowly, you splat punk. When you get there head to the northeast corner and look for... aaah.... well, you need to find an invisible stalker called Bullet, he'll help you - but try not to turn up much before 20:00 hours. Check your PDA as the transition marker can fade in and out!</text>

		<string id="aver_kruglov_dialog_2">
			<text>Ah come on, my name is Scar. General Voronin sent me after Sidorovich heard your alarm. Tell me more about the 'Masters'.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_kruglov_dialog_3">
			<text>I was sending a signal until the battery died. Okay, the 'Masters' base is somewhere in Zaton or in Jupiter. The power of the group is growing by leaps and bounds. The group itself consists of former factions from both the military and hirings, and unfortunately a few scientists. The organizer/boss is a psychopath, but then again very clever. The leader is Lebedev. They created a serious recruitment plan. When I was a prisoner, I could hear some of there discussions. One guy had a name like  Mark, Markan or Marco. They talked about big money. Large money transfers between Master, mercs and Witches. And there are some with invisible exoskeletons. It is easier to fight them at night. And they will soon have in full scale production another exoskeleton that they call the 'Tank'. It's not a vehicle but like a Universal Soldier-Cyborg thing. Supposedly they cannot be killed with a standard weapon. They must be crushed or the use of a gravity gun is needed. When the 'Tank' is in production they will sell them to anyone. To my knowledge they already have orders from the Mainland. Lebedev makes the deals. It all started after the last 2 global emissions. There is a unique artifact and a new science because of them being special. Progress will be made, but not for the benefit of science. I managed to escape from the Masters to Amber through the Wild Territory. But my boss, Sakharov did not run with me because the 'Masters' held his wife hostage and forced him to work for them. I made my way through Wild Territory at night, because it's full of mercenaries, and I also saw 'Witches' there. I got from Wild Territory to here through a transition only I know, and I came here to hide.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_kruglov_dialog_4">
			<text>Wow! You mean so... he was taken to Amber and he will not ever return. I'll try to release Sakharov, your boss, we all need to stop this 'Tank' thingie. Now tell me the number of stalkers in Amber.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_kruglov_dialog_5">
			<text>Scar, are you sure or what? I warn you there is, within a radius of 100 meters, a Zone of protection, with a timer. Without special protection from it no one can survive for more than just one minute, and with 61 seconds comes instant death. Protection can be disabled, the switch is in the bunker. I think there's only Sakharov and 5 guards there. Four usually outside, and one guard inside the bunker. Follow Sakharov, you'll need to get close to the bunker, kill the guards without hurting Sakharov, all within a minute! We need to get to the cave under the marsh to get through to Wild Territory, but there are now two Controllers in the cave and sometimes a bloodsucker. So follow me please, I need you to clear out the cave so we can go to Wild territory. Ok? On the way out at the upper level is a box with a nice outfit and gun. So make sure you pick them up. Oh and sorry about yet more Iron Maiden.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_kruglov_dialog_6">
			<text>Nice tip Professor, I will check the box on the way out. I know the cave you mean and I think there are marsh cockroaches along the way too, so let's go together. When we reach the swamp it's best you wait for me in the swamp near the underwater cave entrace while I clear out the cave. Once I am out I will look for you there. Another Iron Maiden track, really?! I think Led Zepplin's 'In Through The Out Door' would be more appropriate!</text>

			<text>I don't understand anything, let alone much of what I read.

He is driving me wacko! Is Lebedev a magician, like the beatnik looking guy Doug Henning?!</text>
		</string>

		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog_0">
			<text>How did you fall into the clutches of the 'Masters'?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog_1">
			<text>I was freezing my buns off and noticed a fire. So I go there and the Masters jumped out and captured me. It was a freak'n trap. And they interrorated me too. You know, waterboarding me to get me to talk. Check your PDA, I gave you a recipe for an artifact conversion.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog_2">
			<text>For the recipe thanks. Okay go warm yourself and I'll talk to your boss. Who are these 'Masters' for crying out loud?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_dialog_0">
			<text>Well, thanks for the recipe. What does it mean? And what about X-16?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_dialog_1">
			<text>It means you need to disable the installation of a new Laboratory in X-16. The problem is that there is no transition into X-16, so to enable a transition you'll need to find a activator/deactivator for the Psi-field that is around the entrance. It's similar to the field that was around the bunker, but it only has a radius of 80 meters and a timer for 1 minute. You'll need to think and act quickly. One thing, how many 'Masters' guards that are near the entrance to the lab I do not know, and know that some may be invisible. You have to be careful and smart. They always have Radar. But at least I know roughly where the deactivator is. The best stradigy is to run in and kill one or more of them and then run back out before the timer finishes, over and over again, until they are all dead.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_dialog_2">
			<text>So where is it?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_dialog_3">
			<text> The Deactivator is in the brick building to the entrance to the lab, it's on the 3rd floor in the window opening, in a rucksack. Well, unless it's been moved. It's not a complex device. Disabling the protection zone will automatically open the transition into Lab X-16 and it will appear on your PDA map. I beg of you Scar to disable this protection field, and I will tell you a lot about some of the valuable modifiers. Take this tuned Psi helmet. Voronin promised to send his men to guard this bunker.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_dialog_4">
			<text>Ah Voronin's guys, that's good. There is this guy called Dimon who is looking for his father. Maybe you know something about that. If anything he would be a great guard for you. The Psi-helmet looks horrible, hope it works, but thanks anyway! Well I'm off I go into X-16.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_0">
			<text>Are you okay Professor? What happened to Kruglov?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_1">
			<text>You know Kruglov too? Well it was the worst of bad timing, Kruglov came round the corner just as I arrived with my guards, they recognized him and shot him on sight. They would have shot me too if you hadn't intervened.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_2">
			<text>Damn, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have let him get ahead. We were coming to rescue you... damn it to hell. Well at least I got here in time to save you. So let's complete Kruglov's plan, how many of these 'Masters' are there in Amber? Or do you call it Yantar? Even approximately?! Oh, by the way, do you remember me?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_3">
			<text>You are Scar? I heard Kruglov mention that name. Aaaah this is pointless. The 'Masters', as they are called, are invisible and almost impossible to kill. Only at night do you stand a chance. I don't know what Kruglov was thinking. All he loved was the Zone, the anomalies, the company of mutants. Oh brother what a pity he came back and got killed! Yantar or Amber, they both mean here, call it what you like.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_4">
			<text>Yes they call me Scar. I wish I had come here alone, but I did not know the transitions. The penalty was for your partner. Now Professor I've seen... well, not seen, complete invisibility in Dark Valley. Now tell me everything.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_5">
			<text>Well there's six guards. A guard in the bunker, which watches me, but sometimes two watch when they change shifts. Outside is a third and two that are invisible. And those two you just eliminated. From the bunker, within 120 meters approximately, is an active Psi radiation field. You will only be able to be in it for about 45 seconds, and if you fall under its influence you will live only as long as an ordinary lit match, so there's no way you can take them on with this active Psi field. I see one single option Scar. My 'Masters', ahem, allow me out here for fresh air, and I have no Psi-protection, for that you need special armour and an injection. They open temporary one-way teleports to move around. The return teleport device, a URT, is left under a truck, a ZIL. I can adjust the URT but I will need to warm it up for five minutes by the fire, if the return teleport opens too early they will be very suspicious and be ready and waiting. In the meantime you stop any zombies that come close, don't kill any more than you have to as they will attack the Masters too. Then I'll take the URT and try and use it over there, a little closer to the bunker, and we may need to do some waving of our arms to see each other. Next you will, in a very short time, you will be able to teleport into the bunker through a bubble next to me, and remove the guard immediately and send me an SMS that the guard is removed. Then I will teleport in and turn off the Psi-field and lock all the doors. Then you are free, without injections or Psi-helmet, to eliminate those guards outside. Well how do you like my plan Scar?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_kruglov_new_dialog1_6">
			<text>Wow you think quick Prof! So, we have a plan and it means we live Professor. Ingenious too! No wonder I once decided to help scientists and... I hear something coming... ok Prof it's time to act quickly!!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_new_dialog_0">
			<text>Well professor, so far so good. But how do I get outside to finish the job?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_new_dialog_1">
			<text>Excuse me Scar. Indeed, I see that the door is now also locked from the outside.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_new_dialog_2">
			<text>Come on teleport me back. I don't know how we're getting out otherwise.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_new_dialog_3">
			<text>Yes Scar, ok the teleport is behind you, just walk up to the far PC on the table.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_new_dialog_4">
			<text>See you soon!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_0">
			<text>I'm back General. I hope you have calmed down after the kidnapping of your wife. Question why not strengthen positions at the southern exit from the Bar?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_1">
			<text>Well the place has sort of calmed down a bit. I was informed of your exploits in Cordon. You did a great job. Listen now, I have a proposal for you. Before I learned about the kidnapping of my wife I was haunted by the excessive arrogance of Hog, the bandit leader in Garbage. Then I found out that Prapor takes bribes for passage to the Bar, rather than following his orders. Before I could act Prapor escaped, but I don't think he will have gone far, as he knows almost no one well, and his legs are short. I know we are weak to the south, but the only real danger would come from Wild Territory. Lebedev's clans rule there for the moment at least. We heard about your negotiations with the bandits at the checkpoint and really appreciate your ability to gain some temporary peace with them, and so our group will act with respect even though you are a former mercenary. I have some news for you. Your friends here in the Zone have managed to get your daughter moved to Germany into a good hospital, but her treatment will be cost 2,000,000 in Rubles. So I suggest you try to find jobs.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_2">
			<text>Thank you General for the news. I must thank my friend some day. How will I raise 2 million rubles?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_3">
			<text>Well now, seeing as you asked... have you worked with silent weapons?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_4">
			<text>Well in my youth I loved archery and knife throwing.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_5">
			<text>Excellent! If you shoot a bow then you should cope with a crossbow. I want you to eliminate Hog in Dark Valley. I currently do not have any good snipers, but I have good intelligence, the best in fact. If you accept this job I'll give you an advance of 100,000 rubles, and after a successful completion you'll get another 400,000. To get to Dark Valley you will have to go through Wolf's Lair now. The transition I will put on your PDA. In a forest hut find grandfather Shchukar. I'll notify him you're coming. He is my informant. I warn you now that he can be... aah... difficult. Anyway he will tell you everything and he will supply you with a crossbow. He will then give you a transition to Dark Valley. There you will have to find my best scout, he is called 'Bullet'. Whatever you do, don't go straight to the bandit base, which is located in the Northeast part of the Dark Valley, because they have a Psi field which is very effective. Three of our men have already died trying to approach the base. Bullet said Hog always goes for a brief break onto a roof top for a breath of fresh air from 20.00h to 21.00h. Bullet will have detailed instructions and can tell you the best place to shoot from.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_start_6">
			<text>Well that sounds pretty simple General. Just make a note on my PDA so that nothing is missed, and I guess I'll be back pretty soon.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_0">
			<text>Well General Hog is dead.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_1">
			<text>Bravo! A job well done. Would you like to join us?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_2">
			<text>Thanks General, but no I don't want too join your group at this point in time.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_3">
			<text>Ok, well as for your fee, I have yet to see your work.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_4">
			<text>What does that matter, all you need to know is Hog is dead.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_5">
			<text>I am saying that I only have your word that Hog is dead. While you were in Wolf's Lair Sidorovich called, his radio detected an alarm - it was very short, but clear. From what Sidrovich could work out the signal was close, only about 2 km away from his hut in the 'Wolfs Lair'. Previously there were scientists working to study the caves there. There are a few caves in Wolfs Lair, one near the hut, and one under the central marsh, but the signal indicated the Northwestern part of the Lair, and somewhere in that area should be a third cave about the same place where the Oleg Tango group camps. So be a friend and find the cave and see what's there. Say 'yes' and you'll get your money. Sidorovich asked you to see him when you arrive.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_borov_prapor_ok_6">
			<text>I wonder... well, okay General, 'yes', I will go in search of the cave. The air in a cave is cleaner and with fewer anomalies at least. As for Sidorovich I will go to his hut and see if he has any additional information.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya2_dialog_0">
			<text>Ok, so how do I get to the Clear Sky base?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya2_dialog_1">
			<text>Well then Scar... we need to use the artifact 'Black Hole'. I'll give you one now. Let me explain how this works: go and stand somewhere sensible, then put the artefact in your pistol hand and 'use' it, like pulling the trigger. This creates the return point from the Clear Sky base. I'll create a transition to take you to the base, so stand a little way away from me. When you get to the base you will have to find another 'Black Hole' to create the return transition. Go to the house that used to hold the repairman, get up on the boards to the right and you will get to the roof. There is a rucksack in a tree, and you need to jump on that side gable roof to reach it. In that rucksack you'll find another anomaly 'Black Hole', so you can create the return connection to the first Black Hole you used. But there is one thing - when the two anomalies are activated, anything can use it, any livestock, including hostile stalkers. So before you activate the return anomaly from the base, from the building that held Lebedev, find the five absolutes. You must pick them up and bring them to me.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya2_dialog_2">
			<text>Uhmmm, so I use the first Black Hole you give me, this creates my return point. Then using your transition I go to Clear Sky base, to find another Black Hole in order to return. What are the Absolutes, and why do you need them so badly?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya2_dialog_3">
			<text>The absolutes I will take to the scientists to study, and, with care, they will create versions of black holes. About Lebedev, meet with him, shoot straight, and then you will convince him, in your abilities. Lebedev's out there now, I think in the Bar, hiding because he planned some crimes in the area, and the military would arrest him if he was to leave, so be careful Scar! Now I set the teleport to one side, and you activate your 'black hole'... just stand back a bit further away... go on, away... Oh and be careful in the Clear Sky base, it is occupied by many Mercenaries!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya2_dialog_4">
			<text>Okay, I'll activate the 'black hole'...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya3_dialog_0">
			<text>Done! I found some Artifacts and Absolutes. Lebedev was not at the base, just a few guards that, well, I had to eliminate.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya3_dialog_1">
			<text>Excellent Scar! You're a genius. Lebedev now cannot be invulnerable without them. Worn on the belt they create a portal radius. If threatened then teleporting to another location is possible. Whoever has this artifact on their belt has almost nothing to fear because they can teleport to another location within about 500 meters from where they are.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya3_dialog_2">
			<text>Well your the genius. Where did you get so much information? Here take the Absolutes. I do not need them and I surely don't want to understand them by reading an encyclopedia. To much reading makes my brain-cloud act up.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya3_dialog_3">
			<text>I'm not just a technician, I am a technician with experience!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya4_dialog_0">
			<text>What the hell was that?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya4_dialog_1">
			<text>I don't know... these Absolutes... can do wonders... however not all wonders are wonderful. I put a couple of recipes on your PDA, look at them at your leisure. Now let's get to Cordon.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya4_dialog_2">
			<text>Impressive, but I would say those wonders we just killed where not fake. Well yea it's time to the Cordon. It's straight past the church. It's a shame we cannot just transition there like Lebedev.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya4_dialog_3">
			<text>Gee... run or walk?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="kostya4_dialog_4">
			<text>Either will work for me. Let's move to Cordon.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_dialog_bar_0">
			<text>Greetings General, you look a little out of sorts? Are you constipated?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_dialog_bar_1">
			<text>No, my wife has been kidnapped. I just found out. She worked in journalism. She once told me journalist are untouchable! Fool! The kidnapper's leader says for her freedom he wants a complete dismantling of 'Duty'. I now have the benefit of a month for reflection. I already know why you came, and about the latest developments in Cordon and in Agroprom. When you are finished with the scientists we need to talk. The 'Tango' group is here in the Bar. Go talk to the clown wearing the cowboy hat, then talk to the sexy bitch in black leather.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_dialog_bar_2">
			<text>I am sorry to here about your wife General. Well I'll talk to clown now.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_dialog_bar_3">
			<text>Thanks, see ya Scar.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="and_muzlo_dialog_0">
			<text>Well I assume the transceiver is working. Can we listen to some music?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="and_muzlo_dialog_1">
			<text>Yes! We like to listen to music too, and it also keeps the mutants away.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="and_muzlo_dialog_2">
			<text>Pump up the volume gorgeous.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="and_muzlo_dialog_3">
			<text>Sure, no problem.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_0">
			<text>Hmmm, Lebedev, what an ass, the former head of the 'Clear Sky' faction, and now the leader of some criminals. You of all people... really?! In your sixties too. To hell you will go, and that is just around the corner!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_1">
			<text>Oh Scar! Don't be so sanctimonious. How many innocent souls have you yourself put under the cross. Or does my memory play tricks... anyway... I called you to seriously discuss your existence.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_2">
			<text>This is how to understand my existence? What do you want? I had one such conversation two years ago about my existence.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_3">
			<text>I want you to work for me. I need you because no one else knows the Zone better than you or I. It is better to help these soldiers who have no country. Look, I know where they hide, those renounced famed eggheads. They cheated me and are hiding in Cordon. But not for long will they find Cordon a paradise. Some time tomorrow they will find out! Scar, I'll give you invulnerability and a lot of money. Look I tell you, my daughter is very sick, as they say, for the sins of the parents are afflicted upon their children. I steal yes, but to get money for an operation in the most expensive clinic.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_4">
			<text>I'll find my own way Lebedev.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_5">
			<text>What... you are a fool Scar! In the Zone there is a stalker who got rid of the same disease as that of your daughter. Believe me right here in the zone. To shoot me I do not advise. I'll throw you a kilimeter into the air and you will splat on the ground. Just guts, in different directions. Ha-ha-ha! You know what I mean - thud, splat, slop all over!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_6">
			<text>I am aware of your abilities you bastard. If activator goes with you, then I'm gonna bust it out of you like a coin from a piggy bank. As for those absolutes that you use to be invulnerability, well I have taken them from you. Do not be surprised, I was in your base, so that I know that you can 'jump' away from bullets.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="agr_lebedev_dialog_7">
			<text>What? How could this happen? Where are my absolutes you bastard scumbag?! Give them to me or regret it.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_0">
			<text>Wow, we all finally made it.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_1">
			<text>Looks that way to me.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_2">
			<text>I have an idea, why don't you mumble incoherent semi-russian-serbo-croatian at me?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_3">
			<text>Ok, no prablymskio! Victor needed to leave the Bar because he was as drunk as a skunk, and they told him to get out. There is another stalker called Airborne who is on a mission. Now you must go to Demyan, his concealed camp is to the west.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_4">
			<text>Ok! While we are waiting, I have one more question.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_5">
			<text>What?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_6">
			<text>You said you would have more information. And this Strelok guy is always one step ahead of everyone. Have you questioned all the others?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_tango_ataka_dialog_7">
			<text>I can vouch for them... they are my buds. Anyway I have a funny feeling that in a little while the bad guys will arrive, probably from the North. It's just a hunch of course.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_0">
			<text>Well it seems that I run the installation now, and in that case you should come to the surface. Only I wonder, what do you have. If you do not comply then I will shoot you, and if you comply then you can live, but without weapons. Going up?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_1">
			<text>Please do not kill me! I was forced to work here. I have nothing to do with anything. To start the installation we still have to wait at least a week, and now all...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_2">
			<text>I don't believe you. I met the scientists a few days ago and they do not usually know how to handle weapons but these thugs carry machine guns and fight tenaciously. And you're here to try to resume what was once disabled by a stalker nicknamed 'Strelok'. He did it to save lives and you for money... aaahh scumbags. Now tell me who's in charge here, these 'Masters'? And where to find them?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_3">
			<text>I really do not know. Only one thing I can say. They are somewhere in the far north in the Zone and run a radio with a distorted voice. Please do not kill me!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_4">
			<text>Yes, okay. One thing, where's the DVD with Professor Sakharov's formulas?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_5">
			<text>The drive?! Oh... it's behind that door, but it should not be opened. Behind that door is a faulty copy of the cyborg 'Tank'. He is here to experience a large dose of Psi radiation. We planned to start the installation soon and on this cyborg we experiment.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="x10_uch_dialog_6">
			<text>Come on open it up, let's look at your can'tank'erous cyborg reject. I'll kick its ass! I'll pick up the DVD and then we can get out of here.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_0">
			<text>Well, your friend Hog, he, uhmm, had an accident. Yea, that's it, he fell onto a bullet.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_1">
			<text>What? Hog?! Wow... and... uh... hey aren't you Scar?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_2">
			<text>Yes I'm Scar... you remember me from the Duty checkpoint in Garbage. Good! Anyway Voronin sent me. Now tell me how to disable the artificial Psi-radiation field around the northern factory. Our mutual friend told me about it. He had asked me to remove Hog and any other stalkers that get in my way. So help me to disable this damn field.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_3">
			<text>Okay Scar, welcome! Now we too like you cannot pass through this area because Hog disabled our defenses against it, which is issued to each guard in Hog's clan. The protection area effective up to 80 meters. You can only disable it with a deactivator which I think is in the camp near the garages. There is simply no antidote, and I'm sure you've realize that. But there's a 'reformed' Psi-dog, white in colour, that we call 'Bax'. And he has been trained to steal. You can use Bax to fetch a deactivator. However, Hog hated that dog and has it locked in a basement. In short Scar you'll go to the southern gate of the northern factory and command Bax to steal it for you. Afterwards he'll then run towards the transition to Garbage. Try not to lose sight of him. There he'll drop the deactivator and go through the transition to Garbage. After you've got the deactivator your PDA will be updated so you are immune to the Psi field. Then all you have to do is break into the base and find the documents. Just do it! Oh and the dog, Bax aways sleeps at night, so go there in the afternoon.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_4">
			<text>So go to the southern gate of the northern factory, give a command, watch for the dog, follow it to the transition, pick up the 'thingie', go back to the base, kill all the bandits, find how to deactivate the force field? Are you joking?! Give me a hint or two at least?!\n\n</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_5">
			<text>%c[255,255,128,1]Yeah sure... what the hell... why not... I'll wing it. If I pull this off they will write a song about me - 'Who let the dog out?'.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_6">
			<text>C'mon Scar, you know you love a challenge. To help clean up the area as best you can of bandits would be greatly appreciated. If Bax's tail pops up then run straight to the fire truck near the refueling building. Don't get to close or you'll turn into a zombie. If you pull this off then I owe you. We heard that you have a daughter that is seriously ill. Perhaps we can help you.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dja_dja_dialog_val_7">
			<text>Thanks, I appreciate your thoughts about my daughter. With Hog gone you could be the next great bandit 'Kahuna'.</text>

			<text>I found a good guy in the Marsh called Kostya. Teleport specialist. Will undoubtedly be useful to you. Was a great help to me in entering Lebedev's base. Lebedev was not there, just mercenary guards, and I found a few absolutes that once belonged to me.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog2_1">
			<text>Excellent Scar! We sent a message to the checkpoint in Agroprom about who disappeared. First contact was with him, but Scar, I still don't know if the message has got to the military team in Agroprom. The military helped the scientists to get to us, and we have to warn them. Yes, I'll give you coordinates to the transition to Agroprom, used by the scientists. It may be better to go through the Dump, as we've seen mercenaries, and strong radioactive field if you arrive there from our Cordon. I'll give you some ammo. Well, like to go?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog2_2">
			<text>Good! I'll go to Agroprom and talk with the Military Commander in Agroprom. I'll go through the Garbage, see if I can find a trader maybe...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog1_0">
			<text>Whoa, what happened there... where's the sniper and who did he shoot?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog1_1">
			<text>Hell... the scientists will need to hide in the cellar, they can rest there too. Solvador informed me that accidentally intercepted conversation between the mercenaries and Lebedev. They are preparing to attack the complex SRI in Agroprom. But the radio for the military does not work at the moment. Scar can you go and warn the commander of the Research Institute of the impending attack on the complex? And also in the Marsh we got a steady SOS signal. Who needs help is not known. Yep, that's another matter. Look as long as you help us I'll give you an AK74, scope, and some ammo, it's all yours, though a bit old. The commander of the checkpoint is a bit weird, he lets his troops drink on duty, so be careful around them. I'll put coordinates for the transition to the Marsh on your PDA. Well, Agroprom or Marsh?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog1_2">
			<text>To the SOS in the Marsh! About Agroprom, we sent a messenger to the roadblock. It's a long time since I was in the Marsh.</text>

		<string id="uch_dialog1_5">

			<text>Damn... you're cold... well... okay, thanks, you've saved us Scar. We have one more request. Since Lebedev wants to kill us we need help from the Bar. No one wants to go, so please go to the Bar and talk to Voronin and the 'Tango' group members, and ask them to come and protect us for a fee? The 'Tango' group leader is called Oleg. They are loners and no one really knows what they are usually up too. Voronin is a tough cookie so don't be a wise ass with him. The duty guys at the checkpoint will let you through. I'll give you a recipe that I just aquired yesterday.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog3_2">

		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog33_1">
			<text>Since Lebedev wants to come here and take over we need the assistance a group of stalkers that hang out in the Bar. Getting to the Bar can be a real hassel. Solvador I spoke about an interesting group that has helped them break free from the clutches of some mercenaries, and escorted them to the military in Agroprom. The leader of this group is Oleg 'Tango'. They are loners, but their true purpose is unknown. Could you Scar go to the Bar and ask them help us? For a fee! In Garbage at the 'Duty' checkpoint the leader is called Prapor. They say that to get to the Bar he takes money. If he can't get any money he will threaten you somehow. Tell him you need to talk to General Voronin. I know him well, he is a ass. I put a recipe on you PDA. Well?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="uch_dialog33_2">
			<text>Yes I will persuade them to let me pass. The Bar seems is an interesting place. Well if this 'Tango' guy and his group are in the Bar then I will talk to them.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_tango_dialog_0">
			<text>Hi, I've been sent on behalf of the scientists who helped you way back when. They are in danger in Cordon. Lebedev knows their whereabouts and plans to attack Cordon. They ask you to help them, not for free, of course. If your group does not mind I'll go with you to help protect the scientists.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_tango_dialog_1">
			<text>We have a problem. There is a group of 'Arrow' stalkers that are always a step ahead. What their purpose is we just don't know. They must be under some sort of contract and are paid large fees, according to rumors anyway. I have been told about you and your positive actions, but how do I trust you? Your up for hiring, so anyone could hire you! Okay, I'm sorry, I have bad nerves this week. Okay so be it we go to Cordon. If you're with us get to know our group first. Talk to Anya the girl in the black cat suit.</text>

		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_est_dialog_1">
			<text>Thank you Scar! You are a valiant stalker. If you decide to go to Radar, then I have a warning for you. The 'Masters' are guarding it as they are working hard to accelerate the restart of the Brain Scorcher. If you're lucky Scar find my disk with formulas that was half of my life's work and return it to me. Please! I've been told that Strelok was in the Laboratory X-10, which is in Radar. In the laboratory there might also be some scientists recruited for work, under the protection of the 'Masters'. Starting the Brain Scorcher and the 5 Psi antennas can only be done from inside this laboratory. I will try to contact the military to support you in Radar, and I hope that his wife was released. The Masters tried to communicate with him and then with me. I said nothing! Frankly I'm confused.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_saharov_laba_est_dialog_2">
			<text>Rather than ramble on in semi-Russian Professor, I'll just say that you should go to Cordon. It's not safe here. I'm now very confused about who kidnapped who's wife, but let's hope it gets sorted out. Ask Dimon to take you to the Cordon. If you're lucky, I will be able to return your drive.</text>

		<string id="bur_val_one_dialog_1">
			<text>Well hello uncle hardened mercenary. We three had to run because Hog has not forgiven us for the contract I made with you at the 'Duty' checkpoint in Garbage.

		</string>
		<string id="start_taynik_0">
			<text>Hello gunsmith! Dimak suggested we talk. My name is Scar and I have a question. Did you know stalker nicknamed Strelok? Also, Dimak hinted at some mystery about Arrow?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="start_taynik_1">
			<text>Sure I know Dimak. Strelok asked me to upgrade some of his things a few times. After he successfully disabled the Brain Scorcher he went to the north of the Zone and I've never seen him again. He left the teleport which blocks the entrance to the catacombs here in Agroprom. It looks like a key to his puzzle is down there. One stalker found his notebook in a bandit stash, it describes an alternate way into the underground, and some necesssary device. The place where this device was hidden was not clear, the only clue - 'Rise above the iron way viewpoint'. Lots of folks have searched Agroprom and found nothing. My thought is that 'Iron way' is a railway track, or something related, but honestly a child could work that part out?! To be frank I wouldn't want to find the way in because of the strong waves of mutants in that dungeon. I tell you, some nights the ground shakes from their excited state underground. Anyway if you find the rucksack with the device there will be another note, which should give more details. If you want, you can look around the tracks here in Agroprom, buildings and towers around ir. Of course it could all just be another myth in the zone I guess.</text>
		</string>

			<text>'Rise above the iron way vewpoint'... 'Iron way'... that's great... just great...</text>

		<string id="raf_dialog_0">
			<text>Hello Raphael my name is Scar. Some friends of mine have a big problem. Their partner in the military was to communicate with you. This guy betrayed them and I need from you what you two talked about. They say you approached him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_1">
			<text>Oh, Navy with a blue beret. I met him a week ago in Radar. We drank a lot of vodka, but vodka was bad. I passed out. Later we were caught by a specialist from the 'Arrows' group.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_2">
			<text>Provide specifics, how did you get here and why was he in Radar? You seem very young to be in the zone. Please keep it short too, my ability to interpret Russian is not so good.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_3">
			<text>I'm nearly 18, and I have a black belt, and I can do moonwalks like Michael Jackson. I am in good shape, and I ... ... sorry what was the question?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_4">
			<text>You're nobody special. I said, 'keep it short'!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_5">
			<text>Ok in short, I wanted to come to this area because I was bored working with my father. He is in agriculture and grows potatoes. I met Gastello by accident and he brought me here to this house. I tried to go to Radar but Cap at the barrier sent me to Lukash. I said to Lukash that I wanted to join Freedom. He said I was to young, and just a brat. But he let me go to Radar where I met Navy. Navy sure does drink a lot.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_6">
			<text>Navy, what an idiot. I would have slapped him silly and kicked him in the arse. How did he manage to get out of there? What did you two talk about?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_7">
			<text>Yes, he said he had fled! I didn't think Navy was like that, to run away that is. When I met him for the first time he was cheerful, chattering like a machine gun, and this time he had not said much, as if scared. Navy had a stash in Red Forest, he showed it to me. There he had military binoculars, and so much more. But when I checked yesterday the stash again it was empty.</text>

		</string>
		<string id="raf_dialog_10">
			<text>Okay I'll buy the dynamite, on one condition. I found a weapon in a swamp and it is heavily rusted. Needs a special lubricant 'Menstr', it is called. Girlfriend is out of town. Feng, she does not want to talk to me.</text>

		<string id="raf_dialog_11">

		</string>
		<string id="yan_dima_dialog_1">
			<text>No, I've not found him, but Gastello sent me here to look. I learned about my father from watching B-Ski-B, he was on 'Crimewatchski', with that hot Scottish girl hosting it.... err... anyway, he is wanted for stalkery and sneakery. On his chest is an animal of some kind, from the 'Order of the Cat'. His nickname is Dimak.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="yan_dima_dialog_2">

			<text>I found the thief's cache, Airborne! Strange! I found 5 absolutes. The only time I had the occasion to see absolutes of this type was at the base of Lebedev in Marsh. Coincidence?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_na_as_1">
			<text>Anything can happen. Well I just can't believe that Airborne could do this to us! You say that he was carrying explosives, well Airborne never liked carrying explosives. Even Anya does not carry explosives. However, recently Airborne has conducted himself in a strange way. But why I wonder?</text>

		<string id="oleg_na_as_4">

		</string>
		<string id="oleg_na_as_5">
			<text>Double agent? Twin? Humm, Airborne was on an assignment a week ago in Radar. For a day he did not make contact with us and then he just shows up out of the blue. Previously he was proud to wear his Russian Airborne Troops beret, but since his return he wears a full exoskeleton. I asked him why he isn't wearing his beret, and he said nothing and just laughed. However he did mention that he met a young stalker named Raphael in Warehouses, and he mentioned Lukash didn't like the kid. He also mentioned that Raphael had been talking to some x-army guy.</text>

		<string id="oleg_na_as_6">
			<text>Oleg, I need to talk to this kid Raphael, but I will need a transition to Army Warehouses.</text>

			<text>Hello Lukash, you're looking healthy.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_1">
			<text>Hello Scar, you're as charming as ever. This bozzo Raphael has blown a huge hole in our bloody wall. I guess he found the explosives left over from the war with 'Duty'. That war was about six months ago, and Strelok was here helping us. So this asshole, in one fell swoop, has demolished our defences. I was warned that this guy was a liability.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_2">
			<text>Well, do not be angry at him. He is an interesting guy once you get to know him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_3">
			<text>Interesting? Really?! Then Raphael can start doing some work in Pripyat. We do have one little problem here though. So he can prove himself. Three days ago we shot two creatures near the railway tunnel. We know from special sensors that they are about to come again. How many of them I do not know. But usually 2 or 3. Creatures look a little like civilian zombies, but somewhat translucent. And they cause death by splashing some kind of green crap into the eyes. At first they thought that was some kind of acid, but I'm not so sure. Anyway if that punk kid wants to redeem himself he can kill those creatures. If you want to help him, do so from a distance, otherwise he is not doing any real work.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_4">
			<text>Hmm... Raphael has already shown himself to be dangerous. Maybe he can prove he has some talents, or usefull liabilities if you prefer. I'll talk to him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_0">
			<text>Well Lukash suggests you clear the tunnel entrance. You do know how to shoot a weapon, right? If not you could always build him a new wall.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_1">
			<text>Sure I can shoot!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_2">
			<text>A gun... not your other weapon, right?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_3">
			<text>Yes, err no... ah, well I do like to use my other weapon too. But I don't have any guns right now. I believe Feng knows of three boxes with a Flamethrower, a Remington and an AK-104. Scar can you talk to Feng and ask which weapon I can use? I'll owe you a favour or two! Else Lukash will make me build a new wall.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_4">
			<text>Well asshole, take the Flamethrower! I'll support you but only from a distance, and then if uncle Lukash still does not like you then you can start building the wall.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_5">
			<text>Well asshole, keep the Remington! I'll support you but only from a distance, and then if uncle Lukash still does not like you can build a wall.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_6">
			<text>Well asshole, take the AK-104! I'll support you but only from afar, and if Lukash still does not like you can build that wall.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="raf3_dialog_7">
			<text>Okay, and not for the first time uncle Scar is perplexed! Well you'll get something out of your three choices, and maybe a Rambo fucking too! I'll go talk to Feng about your dynamite, which disappeared with the wall. He-he!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_ok_0">
			<text>Hello Lukash, I see you're still healthy! Anyway the tunnel is cleared and your boyfriend has survived.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_ok_1">
			<text>Well I guess you can get out the crisco and celebrate. Ha-ha-ha!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_ok_2">
			<text>Well enough of the sick jokes. I need to see your trader Skinflint.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_ok_3">
			<text>Yes he's called Skinflint, and he has radiation sickness. He is now in a small wooden hut that is on stilts in a little swamp here in Army Depots where previously lived some old guy called Stalkerstein. You know the place, it's in the middle of the mine field! Have fun getting through that mine field! Anyway go and see Skinflint if you want, just do not kill him nor get to close to him. No one really knows how sick he is, it's like he's a zombie or meshuggah.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_ok_4">
			<text>A zombie? Meshuggah? Really? I could go to Sakharov, I think he knows something about the treatment of zombies. Geez... it's a heck of a trip, since he left Yantar to go to Cordon because it's much safer there.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_ok_5">
			<text>Seriously! Sakharov could cure him? Ok, I'll give you a trail that leads into a forest and then to Cordon through Garbage. If you can save Skinflint it would be a good deed. I may even reward you.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_proval_0">
			<text>Damn, it's my fault! I'm afraid Raphael didn't make it! His black-belt was useless against those mutants.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_proval_1">
			<text>Yeah ok, well, whatever. His boots are full of fodder now. However I thought he would do better. I was going to give you a reward too.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_proval_2">
			<text>Really?! Well I tried! I have a question for you? I need to see your dealer.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_proval_3">
			<text>He's called Skinflint, and he has radiation sickness. He is now in a small wooden house that is on stilts in a small swamp here in Army Depots where previously lived some old guy called Grunter-Hunter. You know the place, it's in the middle of a freak'n mine field! Have fun trying getting through it! Anyway go and see him if you want, just do not kill him nor get to close to him. No one really knows how sick he is, it's like he's a zombie or wacked.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_proval_4">
			<text>A zombie... wacked? Really? I could go to Sakharov, I think he knows something about the treatment of zombies. Geez... it's a hell of a trip. He left Yantar to go to Cordon because it's much safer there.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_dialog_proval_5">
			<text>Seriously! Sakharov could cure him? Ok, I'll give you a trail that leads to Wolf's Lair and then to Cordon through Garbage. If you can save Skinflint it would be a good deed. I may even give you something.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="ari_ak_dialog_0">
			<text>Feng, listen, that old dynamite you gave Raphael nearly killed him! You shafted him... which I guess he's used to by now... but still... Anyway he didn't die and he wants the contents of a box you promised him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="ari_ak_dialog_1">
			<text>Wow... really? The dirty little guy survived, he's tougher than I thought. Ok, so I'll give him a gun, but he will be like a monkey with a grenade I warn you. Listen I need an ARF-F, also known as an AK-203 or even an AK-9. I can tell you where to find one, and I'm not going there because of the hordes of mutants that hang around that area. Bloodsuckers for the most part. Well it's in the water tower somewhere upstairs. If you bring it back I'll pay you, and I'll see what I can give him from the box.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="ari_ak_dialog_2">
			<text>Here's your AK-203. A good looking weapon.\n\n</text>
		</string>
		<string id="ari_ak_dialog_3">
			<text>%c[255,255,128,1]Well then I will go get it. I need some money. And fighting bloodsuckers, well you know, it's a whole lotta fun!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="ari_ak_dialog_4">
			<text>Hot dogs, I've been wanting for this AK-203 for a long time, so here's what I promised.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_skr_ok_0">
			<text>Done! Skinflint, that miser, does not want to talk right now. He is a bit of a fucktard right now, but he remembered the way back here and is already in his workshop.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_skr_ok_1">
			<text>Are you serious? Skinflint is there?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_skr_ok_2">
			<text>I'll go check him out. Even though his gerbal brain is not working correctly yet he should be somewhat useful.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_skr_ok_3">
			<text>Ha, he never had much to say anyway. I'd say he's still wacko sicko! Scar you are invaluable so take this as a reward. Another skin receipe in your PDA. You will always be happy if you join our group.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="as_lukash_skr_ok_4">
			<text>Thanks for the offer, but for the moment I am satified with my endeavors in the Zone. If anything comes up that you think I might like, notify me. Now I'll try to get an intelligent word out of Skinflint.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zdrav_dialog_0">
			<text>How are you?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zdrav_dialog_1">
			<text>Hunsky–dorsky sort of, more or less, give or take. Bit of a headache though. Thank you, you saved me. So I'll give you really good prices for anything you bring me. I owe you bro!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zdrav_dialog_2">
			<text>Sakharov really should be thanked. If not for his antidote you would have become a full zombie! I have a deal for you. I know that you know the stalker who recovered from cancer of the blood caused by the Zone. My daughter also suffers from this.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zdrav_dialog_3">
			<text>Sakharov, yes definitely thanks to him! I am indebted to both of you. For cancer of the blood, I do not remember. I do not think my head works correctly yet. If you recall the name let me know. Here's a recipe I'll put in your PDA. Later when the hands will remember the craft, then contact will be made. I'll fix your weapon, if necessary, and throw in some NATO rounds. And if you see Sakharov before I do please pass thanks from me to him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zdrav_dialog_4">
			<text>Okay I'll pass your thanks on to Sakharov. Scar is my name. I would say nothing usually, but then I trust you as a stalker who overcame a nasty disease in the Zone. When your memory is back immediately let me know. Okay it's time for me to return to Wolf's Lair to see some friends.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_0">
			<text>What's going on General?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_1">
			<text>Scar I called upon you because you are trustworthy. There is a contract out on me! I have a lot of enemies, and do not know exactly who they are. For having Hog killed maybe, but this revenge could be because of someone else. So I ask you to protect me.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_2">
			<text>Uhmmm, well okay, but do I need to be in this room like a sentry at the mausoleum?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_3">
			<text>Scar, sometimes I think you have to many splinters in the windmills of your mind. No! Just stay in the Bar room. You should easily spot those who signed for this contract.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_arena_start_0">
			<text>Well you make me laugh! I will certainly go check on the situation.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_arena_start_1">
			<text>Oh I almost forgot. Someone called into the Bar and said that the iron doors to the upper level of the arena had been opened. There were mutants running around between the first and second levels. Go check it out. We never know what that son of a bitch Arnie is doing over there.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_arena_start_2">
			<text>I need to ask you something. Why do you keep only mutants?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_arena_start_3">
			<text>My nagging wife said 'me or the mutants'. So now I just feed those creatures now. I need some kind of job. Yes I know I am a fool, but I love my wife.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_arena_start_4">
			<text>A noble heart you have. I did not know about the arena until a few days ago. Well I'll monitor the situation and check out the arena.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_0">
			<text>Seems to me that you are Airborne's twin. Airborne recently stole the Tango group's funds.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_1">
			<text>Yes I am, and he I  not be! I am called Navy. What are you doing here Scar?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_2">
			<text>You know me, that's good. I met your twin one evening in Jupiter. I thought he was you at first. There is a matter with the group's money having been taken. I was at Warehouses and met a young guy Raphael who talked about you and how you had gotten into a drunken delirium with the military stalkers. Oleg had sent me there to find out about you and about taking money from them.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_3">
			<text>I definitely was delirious after that counterfeit vodka. I remember that guy and how he licked his weapons clean. I remember drinking a lot and eating nothing. Gastello befriended the guy, and the guy wanted a map showing a stash in Radar. Then I remember nothing. I woke up in Pripyat in a former kindergarten. Anyway, I left. I later found out from Palenque that my twin was involved with some contractors. I though this must be nonsense. Oleg needs to be updated on the situation. It turns out that the 'Tango' group has long been persecuted by the military.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_4">
			<text>Oleg told me that you know the trails between Wolf's Lair and Garbage. So can you show me these trails?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_5">
			<text>Yes, sure why not. Look at your PDA, I'll give you a couple of transitions. But could you talk to Oleg and let everyone know that I'm alive and well and innocent. Understand? I'll be behind you. What if they are all drunk and shoot me instead of my twin! Ha-ha-ha!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_6">
			<text>Well now I believe it's the humor that is different between you twins. Well I'll tell Oleg to set a place at the table for you. Maybe the mutants will dance with delight when you show up. Oleg once told me that he was surprised to see you, err... Airborne, attired in an exoskeleton suit rather that your favorite beret.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_7">
			<text>Yeah well screw those forklifts with all the hoses, gears and no pee tube. No longer will I wear them. I would rather wear a padded bullet-proof jacket. Let Oleg, Kuzma and Dimak resemble organs on metal legs!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_8">
			<text>Did you by chance hear about Strelok and his group?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_9">
			<text>Not completely, but I do know of one guy from that group that is in a prison somewhere in the center of Peacekeeping. He is called Mole.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_10">
			<text>Mole? I think he is a member of Duty. I heard that there is someone else locked up with Mole, but I do not remember his name. I am also wanted by those military stalkers. Do you know the coordinates of the transition to Peacekeeping?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_11">
			<text>No I do not, but Sidorovoch must surely know. I warn you that place is fortified very well with armoured vehicles and helicopters. It is very difficult to pass the defensive perimeter on foot, however if you had wings then it might be doable. In any case I do not recommend that you go there!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vdv_nast_dialog_12">
			<text>Well I will leave now. Sidorovich moved to Wolf's Lair. I will try to find a way past the defensive perimeter. Humm, by air might be possible. Maybe I can fly a chopper there. Thanks for the info. I'll go to Oleg and Sidrovich now.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_0">
			<text>We know who the killer is. He was the one who put a contract out on your head. Arnie the former owner of the arena. He was going to kill you while I was away.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_1">
			<text>Jeez, I would have not believed it of him, and me who had offered him a position as first order too. Peace to his soul, he went to join his Gladiators in Valhalla. I have news for you. I contacted the clinic where your daughter is and her condition is stable. I'll give you as thanks for saving my life 500,000 rubles. It will take you a while to complete the transfer once you have all the money. So now I will go check all my buttheads to see what they are up too. Understood?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_2">
			<text>Yep, got it! Thanks!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_3">
			<text>I am grateful for sure and thank you, but remember I don't owe you my life!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_4">
			<text>I suppose if I saved 'your' wife then this mission would not have been a priority.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_5">
			<text>Scar why are you so... well, of course the life of my wife would have been more rewarding, anyway we have another matter. I have sent several teams to search Eastern Pripyat to spy on the 'Witches', but no results yet. We are also searching Jupiter which is a high risk area with ambushes, Psy-zones and other vermin. Are you still willing to work to save your daughter?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_6">
			<text>Obviously yes! I want to find a stalker who survived the disease that my daughter has. Strelok had it two! Navy is at the Bar and I need to talk to him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_zashita_dialog_ok_7">
			<text>I understand you Scar. Keep in touch. After a while the transfer of the money to the hospital will be complete. Good luck!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_klinika_ok_0">
			<text>Well I've got the 2 million rubles to treat my daughter.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_klinika_ok_1">
			<text>You do not have to worry Scar, all of the money will be used for her treatment, you have my word.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_klinika_ok_2">
			<text>Thank you General, music to my ears!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_klinika_ok_3">
			<text>Just rest and relax! I'll make sure everything is ok!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vedma_dialog_0">
			<text>Hello! I didn't expect to see females in the Zone. Are you a real woman? What are you doing here? Are you one of the 'Witches'?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vedma_dialog_1">
			<text>Do I look like a android?! I am just a modern woman surviving in the Zone. Do you expect me to prove it?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vedma_dialog_2">
			<text>Android... good enough for me. I'll use you! Show me my dear, show me!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="vedma_dialog_3">
			<text>How about I show you my female size 11 boot!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="krot_pred_dialog_0">
			<text>Well if it ain't Mole in a hole! I thought I'd come here to help out, but did not expect to rescue myself. What is wrong with these guys and why do thay act like fascists? I see the Doctor is here too.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="krot_pred_dialog_1">
			<text>I don't know this Swamp Doctor. I heard he owned a farm in Swamps that burned down. I think he lost everything he ever cared about, as he is now supposedly quite bitter. These idiots are using us as bait. Hence you came to help us. Who are you and what are your plans?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="krot_pred_dialog_2">
			<text>They call me Scar. I'm looking for Strelok. Some kind stalkers that I know suggested that you knew Strelok and that you were located here. I suppose the bait worked.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="krot_pred_dialog_3">
			<text>It is best to talk with Doctor. Strelok, he knows more about wtf is going on around here. But he supposedly is not around here.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skrjaga_shp_dialog_0">
			<text>Professor, I come here with a heavy heart, er... I mean on business. You said that you have developed an antidote to reverse the first stage of becoming a zombie? Well the trader in Army Warehouses, Skinflint, has become infected and is at the first stage. So his behavior does not correspond to being completely irradiated. Do you have such an antidote?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skrjaga_shp_dialog_1">
			<text>Yes, of course. But it is only a prototype Scar, so... ah... well... I only have two syringes. But since Skinflint can become a pioneer for medicine let's do it. Scar I will give you one syringe.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skrjaga_shp_dialog_2">
			<text>Excellent professor, now how do I inject him because he does not recognize anyone and is prone to very extreme violence? Ordinarily I'd just shoot him, but that isn't exactly a cure.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skrjaga_shp_dialog_3">
			<text>Wait for night or late evening. Even the zombie body is inclined to sleep. When Skinflint calms down, go up to him and try to quickly make a dialogue with him, then abruptly inject the antidote. But be careful Scar, keep you gun handy as I can't promise what effect the prototype antidote will really have.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skrjaga_shp_dialog_4">
			<text>I'll inject him somehow. Thanks for the words of reassurance.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zombi_dialog_0">
			<text>I am a nurse and I have medicine to give you. Bend over!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zombi_dialog_1">
			<text>Yeah right, well your are ugly like a head nurse.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zombi_dialog_2">
			<text>Give me the keys to the locomotive. Are they under your pillow?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zombi_dialog_3">
			<text>Yes, the keys, here, ugly head nurse.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="skr_zombi_dialog_4">
			<text>Here take your medicine. I hope it hurts.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_s_as_0">
			<text>It is confirmed... the young Raphael also saw the military stalker twin. They drank and compared each others weapons. Navy said he was going to look for Airborne. Possibly you could introduce yourself to this twin, Navy.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_s_as_1">
			<text>That's good. Did he say where to look for Airborne?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_s_as_2">
			<text>He said he was taken to Pripyat to help fix weapons, and he escaped from there, as it was dangerous there.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_s_as_3">
			<text>Well ... we need is a plan. While waiting Voronin wants to see you urgently. He has information for you. Yes Scar I've got one of the 4-digit codes. You did a lot for us so take it. The daughter will need you more than me. I heard about one such veteran neutral stalker, but I do not know who exactly he is. In the interior of the Zone he could not get away and somewhere, either he went to the Bar or Garbage. Surely you can stir up some trouble.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_s_as_4">
			<text>Thanks for the code Oleg! I'll talk to the guys first and then go to Voronin and find out what he wants.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_vdv_nast_0">
			<text>Today for sure feels like a holiday!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_vdv_nast_1">
			<text>Yeah we here real party animals. And you Scar, still wandering around in circles?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_vdv_nast_2">
			<text>I've got a bit of news for you. I found Airborne's twin, called Navy, and he'll be here in a minute or so. I need to talk to Sidorovish.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_vdv_nast_3">
			<text>Ok... that's good news, another reason to celebrate!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="oleg_vdv_nast_4">
			<text>Well don't celebrate too hard he looks like a military stalker so try not to shoot him!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_pred_0">
			<text>Sidorovich, I need some information.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_pred_1">
			<text>Really? How interesting... and what's in it for me ugly?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_pred_2">
			<text>Sid, you said that you know the transition from Cordon to Peacekeeping. Well I need it urgently and in return you'll receive my everlasting respect and a Christmas card every year.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_pred_3">
			<text>Well look Scar, I like you, you know... and... well, as it happens I'm in need a small favour. On the way to the Dark Valley transition is an old quarry which is nearby a pond, and there is a dumptruck there too. There are two Controllers hanging around there, and turning into zombies all who get in their way. So if you kill them in your normal vicious style then I'll give you a transition to Peacekeeping. I hope you can find the location because I have no way to mark your PDA. There is an abandoned trailer and fuel truck nearby the path that you will have to travel on. Two old hags used to live there in a trailer, and once had Karina held captive there. I'm sure you know the spot. How many of them that will appear I do not know. If you get infected head for Sakharov in Cordon immediately, but remember you will be eveyone's enemy, except scientists, until he fixes you up. Have fun!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_pred_4">
			<text>Okay Sidorovich, I'll kill the Controllers, just please tell me the location of the transition to Peacekeeping when I get back.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_protivojadie_0">
			<text>Damn... Sidorovich... damn... what have you done? Freak'n antidote gives me the... jeez, I need the damn antidote.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_protivojadie_1">
			<text>Why did you come here you damn fool!? I told you only Sakharov can help you and he is in Cordon! Jesus, you look like you're dying, run man, run!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_protivojadie_2">
			<text>You ass... you didn't tell me the pain could be this bad... my head... my head... it's bursting.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_kontrik_ok_0">
			<text>I've done your favour Sidorovich now give me the transition to Peacekeeping.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_kontrik_ok_1">
			<text>Seriously Scar do you even know why you want to go to Peacekeeping? I tell you only death awaits lone stalkers in that place. Besides, ha ha, you looked beautiful as a zombie. And seeing you now I believe that the zombie infection can be cured. Tenacious you are Scar!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_kontrik_ok_2">
			<text>You hairless douchebag, because of your little job I had to defend myself against all the good environmentalists and clans. They hate me now.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sidor_kontrik_ok_3">
			<text>They were shooting at you to survive just as you shoot others to survive. You don't care about the ones you shoot do you? Well I'm trying to survive here too thanks to my brains and your feet, and Scar you are still alive so get over it. I use you and you use me, so we're even. Ok?! As for the transition to Peacekeeping go to the area outside the northern checkpoint in Cordon, it's where you arrive direct from the Bar, using the Tango group's transition. Stay outside the fence and go to the southern gates in Cordon, south of the military checkpoint. Use the southern fence as your guide and go to its eastern corner, then look southeast, up a hill, you should see two small Christmas trees standing close together. Well there between the two Christmas trees is the transition. A tip... in Peacekeeping rules are similar to the Soviet laws of 1937. I have heard there's lots of loot there so I advise you to remove excess weight before heading to Peacekeeping or take a rucksack. Oh and unlike here the military pretty much fire without warning, so I suggest you take a few spare grenades too. So good luck, and errr... goodbye Scar.</text>

		<string id="sidor_kontrik_ok_4">
			<text>I never would have guessed! No wonder no one has found this transition to Peacekeeping before. Okay I'm outta here!</text>

		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_0">
			<text>Professor! HELP ME!!!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_1">
			<text>You look like your dead... ok ok Scar!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_2">
			<text>Hurry!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_3">
			<text>Yes yes, now close your eyes Scar... yes, that's it!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_4">
			<text>Ouch, ahhh that hurts!! The controllers they were dressed in long black coats.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_5">
			<text>Yes, we have already seen those mutants! Maybe a little of what made them human remains. We will need to study them more.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="sahar_kontrik_ok_6">
			<text>Wow... I'm feeling better already... wow, now I want a vacation for a year.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_vdv_nast_dialog_0">
			<text>How's the mood? and How did you become a member in Oleg's group?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_vdv_nast_dialog_1">
			<text>Excellent! Also I do not want to say this more that once, but since you and I think the same way I will give you a recipe and tell you a story. Listen carefully Scar and do not interrupt me, I don't want to repeat myself. It all started with the fact that at the Cordon checkpoint we came face to face with a jerk. Who he was I didn't know, and he was wearing glasses and was in civilian clothes. He was following a map and went directly to the commander. After that he went to get cleaned up. I am not completely sure what they were talking about. The commander was angry, they had argued like a couple of bloodsuckers. The commander said 'fly to East Pripyat and deliver this cargo to those eggheads there'. This guy said there were to many mutants there. Then this guy caught sight of Batyn and shut up and then went to Valerka. Anyway we all flew to Pripyat and met with a guy called Prometheus, and he says come over he, we've been waiting for you. Then we went in the direction of the Office of Community Services. As we walked I saw something shining nearby, it looked a little like Grandmother Beads. I thought it could go to 'R/D' if Sidorovich would trade for some vodka. Anyway we meet with some egghead in a white coat, and next to him is a case. He was very overweight. The scientist in the robe comes over and says to handcuff the case to my arm and to go to the helicopter.I assumed there was valuable information in this case. Valerka asks if I new where we were. I said: duh we are in East Pripyat. He then said there won't be many stalkers around in the daytime. I said: why the hell does this heavy box have to be secured to an arm. What then began: this asshole in a bathrobe jumped with anger. Yelling at us and called us uneducated morons among other words. He said that the case has important and sensitive information. And that half of the scientific world would give up their sex life for it. So Valerka and I and the case go to the chopper. We boarded up and flew away. I still do not understand why Lenin and Meresyev decided to fly through the Military area! The military shot us down with RPG's. The next thing I new was that I was on a stretcher. Mercenaries, their mother is not there and not so! Four or five of them at once opened fire on us. Egghead with flyer immediately ran, and we fell back behind the decks. So they, bitch, throw grenades started. Well, a little hooked, concussions me. Came to, and they are over Valerka and something of their fluttering.Then one of them, the main they see it was bent and the hand to which the case had been fastened, Valerka snapped. My God, that was the cry of death. I will not forget such a cry, it was worse than a bloodsucker. Valerka well alive was when he his hand And then they have finished it. I reached out to get his AKMS. Do not believe me right, I would not have believed it. Do you remember saying that some kind of crap is found in Pripyat. So this is it those bullets, or rejected, or slowed down, or all at once did. And the armor was good for me. And then ... I open my eyes and the room was mostly white and some girl was holding my hand. I think to myself, yeah I'm in paradise. And then began some pain. I thought that my brain will explode. The girl is looking at me and injected me with something. I passed out. Several times I had awakened with pain and each time the girl gave me a shot of painkiller. And then I completely woke up, and I was in a little room next to the young guy. I have didn't have any pain, but there was pressure on my chest as if a tank drove over it. I move one arm then the other, then I tried to sit up. There are miracles. I am still alive. </text>

			<text>Erzähl weiter?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_vdv_nast_dialog_3">
			<text>Then a doctor came in and updated me on the situation. The military sent a patrol to collect corpses, and well, they found you and brought back to the base. You where identified by hospital personnel.I could smell perfume from his handkerchief. I got up and left and went to the base commander to introduced himself and asked for permission to contact Batya to get a chopper ride back. I was ordered to remain on the base for a couple of more days until transport was available. Well, orders are orders, I remained. I decided to wander around the area and talk to people. Maybe even find vodka. I go walking around and there were four barracks. I tried to go into one of them and they wouldn't let me enter. I noticea at the entrance of a barn nearby a guy in full gear as if ready to go somewhere. I found no one that could help me including him. In the evening before going to sleep I decided to have a smoke. I went out on the porch and saw at the gates a truck driving into the base. And it went straight to the barracks where that fully outfitted guy was. I quietly approached the barracks and saw people in white coats climb into the truck. Of course I was very surprised. I was wondering why would these people be in the Zone? Conventional eggheads I tought, but they all had special suits on. Well the truck left went through the gate and took the fork in the road that led to Radar. So now I go back to get some sleep. And in the morning Batya came in and gave me a lift to the Bar. I was drinking and told Oleg about my experience. He allowed me to be part of his Tango group. To this day I still have no idea where those people in the white outfits where going. I can only assume that they where going to some lab.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_vdv_nast_dialog_4">
			<text>What a story! I myself suspected in Warehouses many phenomena. Mutants appear from nowhere. For the recipe thanks. I'll go speak to Sidorovich.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_stvol_0">
			<text>Keep the weapon and ammunition.</text>

		<string id="krot_stvol_1">
			<text>Fantastic.</text>

		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_0">
			<text>Now do you believe me when I say that I am trustworthy Doctor?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_1">
			<text>Of course not! But thanks for the help Scar. Then again your help can have a double meaning and an insidious hidden intent.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_2">
			<text>What can I do to make you trust me?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_3">
			<text>Go to the grave of Fang. It is in Army Warehouses close to where he was killed. I was there and saw the grave, there is an inscription on it. If you think that the X-16 corpse is really him, then bring the corpse here and we will see for sure. To find the grave look for a place close by where he was shot, near a wooden cross on the edge of the village and close by is a two story brick electricity tower.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_4">
			<text>All right since you do not believe me then I'll go. I'll find a grave and I will also bring you the body from X-16 and then you can decide what's what.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_5">
			<text>Yeah, fuck you Doctor I'm bored with your dry old hatred of life. I'll find the grave, but I am no hearse. If necessary you go and look for the body in X-16.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_6">
			<text>The corpse is certain not to please you, it will be heavy I know. Go to Garbage, then to the forest behind the fallen tree. Last year I left a neutral exoskeleton there. I doubt it will be in good conditon now, but it can carry 70-80 kg, with little effort. If it's still there use it. It's close by the transition from Cordon, and to your right as you arrive.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_7">
			<text>Okay Doctor I'll take a look but I have little doubt it will still be there, or useable.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_ne_verit_shram_8">
			<text>Your karma will lead you!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit_shram_0">
			<text>'Habeas Corpus' Doctor. The unbearable stench! That grave, the date of death doesn't match the time of the shooting of Fang. I departed after the shooting, so Doctor there is a discrepancy.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit_shram_1">
			<text>I see Scar, yes, I see... oh my!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit_shram_2">
			<text>What do you think? Where do you want the body?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit_shram_3">
			<text>This is not Ghost! Well it is his armor but not his teeth. Someone made up the rumors. Ghost could make up any nonsense and then use someone else's corpse. But why?! To hide from himself? It looks like he really killed Fang by mistake and after that he could not look Archer in the eye. So he decided to escape and leave the corpse of this unfortunate stalker. We will bury him properly.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit_shram_4">
			<text>So Doctor are you saying that all three of them Strelok, Ghost and Fang may still be alive. Wow, if I really knew what was going on I'd be quite excited.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit2_shram_0">
			<text>Now do you trust me Doctor?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit2_shram_1">
			<text>Ha, trust you Scar? No, never, men like you are never to be trusted. However I think this time you have told the truth. Listen Scar, Lebedev destroyed everything I had. Costa said that the artifact which protected him from bullets has already lost much of its energy, and I hear he is weak and now tired of fighting. According to my information he is at the base in the Marsh. I think he has gone back there to die.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit2_shram_2">
			<text>Go on...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit2_shram_3">
			<text>If you make up your mind to confront him, and I suggest you hurry, then please also find my documents on the 'Study of  Mutants'. He took them from me before he burned my farm in Swamp. The documents should be at this base or nearby. If you bring back my documents I'll be happy, and not just me. Oh, I almost forgot, there is a big stash of weapons in the Marsh somewhere in the middle near or on a very small island where there are two dead trees. Bandits hang around there a lot, and it can have the information which will possibly lead to Strelok. If he is still alive.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_verit2_shram_4">
			<text>Ok Doctor, well I too am growing old and tired, so perhaps I too should go to the Marsh.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="mar_gastello_dialog_0">
			<text>Sorry about your new helicopter... errr... where did you come from?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="mar_gastello_dialog_1">
			<text>I can't believe that I found a working helicopter only for you to crash it! Oleg sent me a message telling me you might need help.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="mar_gastello_dialog_2">
			<text>Is this going to be another one of those vaguely confusing and pointless conversations?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="mar_gastello_dialog_3">
			<text>Yep that seems pretty likely to me. Oh, Oleg said don't forget to see if you can find the arms cache in the centre of the Marsh to the northwest on a small island with two dead trees. One thing to note, the two transitions you and Kostya created to go to and from the Clear Sky base may well have merged into only one way by now. Make sure you walk through it slowly to allow it to work. Just don't ask me how I know, ok?!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="mar_gastello_dialog_4">
			<text>Well that reminds me I also need to find the documents in the former Clear Sky base in Marsh to take back to Doctor while you stay here. Hmm... yes, this feels very much like another one of those pointless conversations to me. Let's hope we only have it once.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_doki_dialog_0">
			<text>Hello Lebedev. Where are the Doctor's documents?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_doki_dialog_1">
			<text>They are all in the next room.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_doki_dialog_2">
			<text>Who's the leader of the Masters and where do I find him, and where is Voronin's wife?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_doki_dialog_3">
			<text>The main base is in Zaton, and how to get there is very simple. Here is a picture, give it to Sakharov, he should be able to tell you who is on it. Voronin's wife is under the supervision of the Witches, but where she is being held right now I do not know.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="lebed_doki_dialog_4">
			<text>Since you lost control of everything where will you go now?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_ok_dialog_0">
			<text>So what's next?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_ok_dialog_1">
			<text>We need to wait.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_ok_dialog_2">
			<text>What is there to wait for?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_ok_dialog_3">
			<text>Did Bax get the deactivator? If so we can push on to the gas station.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_ok_dialog_4">
			<text>Yes, well let's get a move on we don't have all day.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_0">
			<text>Here Professor, Lebedev gave me a picture of an old woman and said she was the leader of the so called 'Masters' faction. And he added that you know her.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_1">
			<text>That's interesting. Give me the photo. Did Lebedev say anything else?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_2">
			<text>Here you go, and no Lebedev didn't say much at all.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_0">
			<text>Are you feeling ok?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_1">
			<text>No! This is my wife. How could she do that?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_2">
			<text>Are you serious? Lebedev said that she is the patriarch of that faction. What is the name of your wife?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_3">
			<text>Jana Markovna. But how, how? What should I do?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_4">
			<text>Kruglov vaguely heard that someone called the leader Mark, or Marquand. That's where the dog is from too. They most likely said Markovna. Looks like you ignored her a little too much. I'm sorry Professor.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_5">
			<text>You do not have to be sorry Scar, I'm a little guilty of her actions, I have spent too much time with my research and not enough with my wife. She had to find compensation for my lack of interest in her. She is rebelling against my research and the company. She was most likely influenced by Lebedev who is one of her friends, and she is very smart. For her money has become more important than science. This breaks my heart. I had thought she would be sent to me in pieces. But no, it was all a lie, she wasn't kidnapped. She had merely found a new life. Oh well, to hell with her.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_sahar_zhena_poshla_na_6">
			<text>I'm sorry Professor. But at least you have escaped and know the truth. I've got to go now. Good luck.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_0">
			<text>Get that weapon out of my face. I already had enough 'Masters' in my face.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_1">
			<text>Why did you not mention anything about the Absolutes? I would have given them back.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_2">
			<text>Actually I recognized the artifacts as my own, the missing five were stolen by Lebedev. So how did you come by them? Did you have a relationship with that bastard Lebedev?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_3">
			<text>I don't appreciate the allegations. I'll send you to hosiptal in a petri dish!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_4">
			<text>For what services did Lebedev share my artifacts with you?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_5">
			<text>Ok ok... I have a name, Margelov. I will not fight with you. He was showing off the Absolutes. He said he had won them from a commando. But later on he had fallen into a carousel anomaly. Many can attest to this fact. So I took the artifacts. The Absolutes you can keep, you earned them honestly. How was I to know that they were yours! Blah blah blah! Listen wait here for a minute or so and I'll open a transition to Zaton, or Backwater as your PDA shows it. Once you're there follow the trail of notes, you'll need to be able to navigate using 'degrees:minutes:seconds' coordinates. So make sure you have the compass from Agroprom or similar. There's a door code you'll need, '1986', best write that down! Then again everyone on Earth knows that year. Oh, and this is really important, if you get into the tunnels and the doors won't open then blast them with a shotgun, it should free them up. Try shooting the side doors first. One or two shots should do it.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="dvd_bazar_dialog_6">
			<text>Ok I'll wait for the transition. I've the funniest feeling that I should travel light, but with two good weapons. Maybe a Flamethrower, AA-12, plenty of ammo, a couple of spare rucksacks, a few GPS's, and a whole lot of health related items and food. Let's go!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_dialog_0">
			<text>Here we are!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_dialog_1">
			<text>Good job, thank you Scar!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_dialog_2">
			<text>Will you occupy the post of Hog?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_dialog_3">
			<text>Hah! To become the new bandit leader and have even more enemies than I have now, so no I will not take over for him. Did you find the document with the X-18 code in Hog's room? If you've not searched the buildings yet then know that on the ground floor is the arsenal, but there are no good weapons there. Hog I think moved them to a new base. I do not know where it is because Hog keeps many secrets. But I'm not that stupid. I hear things and there's a stalker called 'Ace'. I might be able to put something on your PDA. I'm not sure exactly where he is, but Ace is supposedly somewhere between Dark Valley and Cordon in the territory of Garbage. It's pretty radioactive around there. The rumors among the lads who went out there is that there is a river/creek/pond, whatever, and some Klondikes. Hog planned to move there a long time ago. Frankly I've no idea what you should expect. Look if you find any documents in X-18 take them to Kostya in Cordon. Okay?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bur_val_baza_dialog_4">
			<text>Sure! That's great, thank you for the info. I'll go into the base if I haven't already got that document, hang on... let me check.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_0">
			<text>I am finished Doctor. I collected your documents.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_1">
			<text>Thank you Scar, I thought these were lost forever... you.... you've pleased the old man after all. So now I must tell you a story that you have a right to know. Two years ago when you went to the Clear Sky base what did you to do for your first mission?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_2">
			<text>Well, I woke up in the base, then Lebedev told me a little about the Zone and its impact on the world, and why they where there. The first task was helping at one of their outposts. Well I was running there and ran into three wild boars, and there was no one around to help me, and then a PDA message displayed about an emission coming, and I had to climb a tower to save my life, and then I went unconscious. Later I woke up back at the base in the same bed.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_3">
			<text>Let me say that it was premeditated. Lebedev wanted to test your extraordinary ability to resist emissions. He saw in you all the profit that he could learn from the 'C-Consciousness' and he could call in for additional funding and staff. Next Strelok's corpse after being shot no one could find it. He was in the company of killers who where going to the 'death truck'. Strelok just got the job to kill Arrow. 'C-Consciousness' demanded Lebedev give a refund, but the inhabitants of Chernivtsi bolted to east Pripyat and settled there. The money was great and it did not cost much to create a new clan. He knew that they would survive in any release, as the 'C-Consciousness' had given protection, and you are alive for a third time despite all the dangers of the Zone. Why did Lebedev want Strelok killed?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_4">
			<text>Lebedev told me that the cause of emissions is that Strelok had made it to the 'Brain Scorcher' and screwed with it.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_5">
			<text>So we put everything in its place. I already know you started looking for Strelok, and you where going to thee north. I hope that he and his friends Ghost and Fang are alive. I would like to see all three here in Cordon. Once again I thank you, and if they are found then immediately inform me. We will also share information as long as communication is possible. Be careful. Oh, Voronin called, he wants to see you. Good luck!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_6">
			<text>Thanks. I guess I will go see Voronin.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_7">
			<text>Hold it, I completely forgot. While you where in Swamps Airborne contacted me and wants you to see him about your artifacts. He is in Wolf's Lair. I immediately thought about how Lebedev took your Absolutes. He told me that Lebedev gave 5 of your Absolutes to Airborne for good service. Kostya just showed me similar artifacts, but I don't know if they are yours.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_8">
			<text>Now I see that it is not a coincidence. Things are not as they seem. Thanks for the information. I'll go talk with the Airborne.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="doktor_lebed_ok_dialog_9">
			<text>Roger that Scar. Be careful!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_0">
			<text>I am finished General. I have some news for you. The 'Witches' have your wife, but I do not know where. According to Lebedev the leader of the 'Masters' is Sakharov's wife, Jana Markovna, and their base is somewhere in Zaton.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_1">
			<text>I suppose that is some good news! All is not lost then. Sakharov's wife? Well that's why she had requested to work in Zaton six months ago. The professor will never get over it!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_2">
			<text>The professor will be ok. This news makes it easier to deal with the situation. Maybe we can do something before his wife ends up in pieces. I need to get to Pripyat, but I do not know where the transition is located.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_3">
			<text>Since you are looking for Strelok, I have a request for you. If you learn about my wife then let me know. I can get help. I could send a chopper to rescue her. In Pripyat and Chernobyl there are mainly leftover mercenaries from Lebedev's group, and a few monoliths that are less numerous. Inside the central area is controlled by the 'Masters' and the military and they also share Jupiter, but Zaton is largely controlled by the 'Masters'. Only some really small independent clans survive in this sector, and certainly 'Masters' selling artifacts and other trinkets. Basically, that's the situation. So in summary the place is a total madhouse!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_4">
			<text>Strelok is perhaps also in captivity there, however I hope not. I will do my best to find out what has become of your wife. We must hope that she is held in Jupiter, since I am a little familar with it. On the other hand though there are some active deadly areas that are inaccessible.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_5">
			<text>That's right that area of the Zone is real bad! Even our choppers cannot go into some areas. We had one disintegrate while in the air. By the way Skinflint wants to see you. He remembered something to tell you, and he might know how to get to Pripyat. Oh and don't let his name fool you because he often has the best prices. You might need some supplies, right?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_6">
			<text>Thank you General! I have one request and that is to take care of my daughter by keeping in touch with the clinic where my daughter is located. If anything of importance takes place please let me know by PM! I'll go see Skinflint. Oh, I almost forgot, what is the current relationship between the military and your group?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_7">
			<text>Politics, brother, politics! Some of the supreme leaders believe that I created a group on their account. To me it's just all about money, you know what I mean. Yes I will look after your daughter Scar. I have a surveillance camera with a recording of Strelok passing by here. Probably heading towards the 'C-Consciousness'! I must admit that there is much to learn about our friend Strelok, the 'legendary' stalker.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final_dialog_8">
			<text>Okay, let's watch the first episode's film before going to the next episode!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_0">
			<text>I am finished General! Lebedev's flew off, he's gone!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_1">
			<text>This is good news, amen brother!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_2">
			<text>I need to get to Pripyat, but I have no idea where the transition is located.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_3">
			<text>I understand that you're going after Strelok. I have a request that if you have any information on my wife to let me know, or if you find her please contact me and I will send a helicopter to smuggle her out. So you know, Pripyat and Chernobyl are mainly mercenaries and remnants of Lebedev's monoliths which are less numerous. Inside the plant is controlled by the 'Masters' and military stalkers. These two latter groups also share Jupiter, but in Zaton it is mostly in the hands of the 'Masters'. However there are a few independent clans in that area. That's as much as we know!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_4">
			<text>Strelok might be in imprisoned there too. I will do my best to find out about your wife. Hopefully she is be held in Jupiter rather that Zaton. Those places are really dangerous.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_5">
			<text>Yes some of those areas are really dangerous. Best to avoid them for sure. Even in the air is unsafe. We lost a chopper there not to long ago. Maybe you can get some information from Skinflint. He wants to see you anyway. He remembered something he forgot to tell you. He just might know how to get to Pripyat. Before you go back on the road do you have a special request to make?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_6">
			<text>Thank you General! If I am in need of anything I'll let you know. However I do have one important request and that is to check on my daughter at the clinic every so often. I'll let you know of any information I find. I'm going to see Skinflint now. Does your group and the military get along at all?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_7">
			<text>Not always, politics, you know! The military are somewhat paranoid. They think I put this group together just to spite them. Making money seems to be the biggest problem. Yes I will keep an eye on your daughter. After all I don't have much to do here except surveillance. I have a video of the 'legendary' stalker Strelok passing by!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="voronin_final2_dialog_8">
			<text>Okay, it's time to watch the first episode's film before moving to the next episode!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_0">
			<text>Verdammt bist du schnell.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_1">
			<text>This is due to the Absolutes!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_2">
			<text>At least you weren't caught short. I once had a Simbion, it was awesome. Do you know if there is a recipe to create one?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_3">
			<text>Of course, it's in X-18. In a room behind a coded computer room door. If you get in there then you can have it.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_4">
			<text>Why on Earth did you leave the recipe in there?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_5">
			<text>Oh jeez I guess it's a game to me and I wouldn't want anyone trying to get in there to get bored!! Anyway I barely had time to shut the damn door and code it. There where several mutants after me. I was running low on ammo and there was this freak'n attacking dinosaur looking thingie. In the north of the Zone I came across some really strange things. But in the X-18 it was like miracles taking place.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_6">
			<text>Dinosaurs appearing! Damn must be awesome. I always wanted a T-Rex for a pet.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_7">
			<text>Yep a whole lotta fun! Just so you know there is an 'hour of horror' that will happen when it's least convenient. It doesn't happen everywhere, mostly in the northern zone, but also sometimes in Marshes and Garbage. Here in Cordon never. It is like the 'night of the living dead', mutants, mutants and more mutants. In X-18 there should be documents from our archives. If you find any then pick them up and bring them back to me. Horrors exist in there and sometimes the PDA goes nuts! One time I found a PDA that had a white spot on the map between Cordon and Dark Valley, and the PDA text stated Hannah Montana was going to sing there.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_8">
			<text>I hate going into those labs, however on occasion I am forced to search them for documents, etc. Sorry, please continue.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_9">
			<text>It's weird... all of this weird stuff on that PDA. This gap between Cordon and Dark Valley is strange. According to old documents nothing was ever there. But there must be some kind of clue. If you look at the global map along the Pripyat River you will see the old railway tracks, which oddly divides this mysterious area. Luminosity spots appeared a year ago after the destruction of the Marksman units fo the C-Consciousness at Chernobyl. The luminosity was explained as being some unknown energy field. Other than that, nobody knows anything. Choppers could not sustain flight over the hills there. And there was reported anomalous radioactivity fields. Maybe there is some sort of explanation in the archives in Lat X-18. To find local people who lived in these places before the 1986 accident was scarce. Yes, if needed, Black Holes, flesh eyes, poltergeists, and artifacts Flash or Moonlight. Activate only 'Black Hole' next to the neutrals, and to Cordon I do not advise to do so. The PDA had a special section with lot of disk imaging.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya_dialog_10">
			<text>A real mystery, but quite interesting since the terrain is not all visible and yet a trail must be there somewhere. If destined to be in X-18 then I will check for archives.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya2_dialog_0">
			<text>I found an old document in X-18, and a map too.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya2_dialog_1">
			<text>You survived X-18... wow, that's kewl. Let me have a look at the documents.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya2_dialog_2">
			<text>Here you go... is it anything special?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya2_dialog_3">
			<text>Well, no. It just confirms the passage of the railway through that strange territory. This area was just a dump before 1986, but I don't understand the lit area on the PDA. Who knows what it's really like there now.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya2_dialog_4">
			<text>My information is that Hog is planning to change the location of his base, but to where is not known.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya2_dialog_5">
			<text>Hell if I know. Well, we will look for clues. You will have to head back to the north. Be careful Scar. If anything turns up I'll be in touch.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya3_dialog_0">
			<text>On the way to Hog's base there is some kind of artificial radiation being generated. You do not know how you can disable it?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya3_dialog_1">
			<text>I was also surprised about that. Maybe it can be deactivated by the dog who was guarding me in the basement.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya3_dialog_2">
			<text>Come on, tell me more.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya3_dialog_3">
			<text>There is a dog named Bax. An Albino pseudodog that is all white. Where they got the dog or keep it I do not know, however it did not like thugs. They kept it in the street outside the basement where I was sitting. The command was: 'Bax, take Deactivate' Bax jumped up and ran to the territory somewhere to a garage cabinet, grabbed something like a PDA, so fast that the bandits were after him as yelling kids. They fled in the direction of Garbage and only there to take away the Deactivate. That area was switched off for sure. If you want to act like a Cynologist and try commanding the dog, it is best to give the command in a tower near the first gate seen from the south side. Come close to the basement as the psy-zone should not be active there. Bax late in the evening is very aggressive so it's better to go in the morning or afternoon. Hog and Bax did not like each other. Bax once bit Hog. He-he! Anyway, Can I go with you?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya3_dialog_4">
			<text>No, stay here! I'll try shooting from a bush. The tower should be no issue to climb. I will try to work the dog like a Cynologist. Seems like all is going smoothly to far.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_kostya3_dialog_5">
			<text>Careful Scar and good luck. Remember that it is better to go in the morning or afternoon.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="esc_teleport_dialog_0">

		<string id="zdarovo_0">
			<text>Sidorovich you actually brought that stupid door with you! Don't get me wrong, she could pull something of mine any time she wants. Anyway, I thought you flew off to the Zone center?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_1">
			<text>Up your's Scar. I had hoped that this hut was out of the way from everyone, and it was one way I was sure not to see your ugly face again. Well, so much for that plan! So, did you talk to Fairy and Torych yet? It's worth it, trust me.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_2">
			<text>So do you still trade counterfeit vodka? I guess it helps around here to suppress any bestiality concerns.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_3">
			<text>Aaaaa you idiot!! Yeah the counterfeit vodka from hell. Can you taste a difference? I have a wholly organic product, never filtered to preserve... uhmm... well... it has natural flavors... here try a bottle... it's unlikely to kill you... I think.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_4">
			<text>I'll pass!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_5">
			<text>You did a good job when you were in Cordon Scar. Go on, drink up!!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_6">
			<text>Well okay, for good luck.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_7">
			<text>Yes yes drink, and then I forgive everything. God forbid you should die! Why you make a face?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_8">
			<text>Because it tastes like Chimera fodder! What's not to wince at... phew... my teeth have gone numb. Sidorovich who taught you to make moonshine? Not the Swamp Doctor that's for sure.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="zdarovo_9">
			<text>He-he it's my grandfather's recipe. Handed down from generation to generation. I'll never share it. Have another one, as they say: 'between the first and the last'.</text>

			<text>Nice face with that huge nose. Sure I work odd jobs, if the money's right.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_tor_nout_dialog_5">
			<text>You want a job? The scientists had a link established for access to the internet, but a drunken asshole drinking with Gastello in his shack threw the laptop into a little swamp. It was a good laptop too and the problem is they were so drunk they don't remember which little swamp. It seems like there are two options - either the little swamp near the northern path, or the larger swamp in the middle of the southwest area. I warn you you're going to have to look very carefully. I would look myself but I hate getting my feet wet. I'll give you a good reward if you find it working. How does that sound?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_tor_nout_dialog_6">
			<text>Right... well okay I'll look for the laptop, although I can't see it ever working again!</text>

		<string id="aver_tor_nout_ok_2">
			<text>My reward?</text>

		</string>
		<string id="aver_tor_nout_ok_4">
			<text>Right, sure, great, schumck. I almost got killed there by some huge mutant.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_tor_nout_ok_5">
			<text>Look Scar maybe Fairy can repair the hardware. She is good with hard things. He-he! But we do not have needed software. Sidorovich has only old software. However I have a friend right now at the Bar, Coulter, he's at the Duty checkpoint from Garbage. Check him out, he has a DVD full of software. Do me a favor and go get it and I'll share important info and you will know everything I know. Just to warn you the transition I know delivers you behind the Bar so you'll have to climb over a fence or jump down a little cliff. Watch out for dogs there.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_tor_nout_ok_6">
			<text>Okay, I'll get to it sooner or later. I need to make a decision now, to the Bar for the DVD, or to Dark Valley to kill Hog.\n\n</text>

		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_0">
			<text>Hey Sidorovich. ich hörte dir wäre langweilig?</text>

		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_1">
			<text>Scar ... Du solltest mehr Respekt vor Menschen haben die eine Brille Tragen.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_2">
			<text>Yeah, with the new invisible frames from Eye-Savers. So what's up?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_3">
			<text>Well I decided to access the Internet and immediately got a virus from one of those Russian download sites. It pops up some guys ugly mug with a grin on the screen and displays the text - 'Your computer is infected with the most dangerous virus', and to destroy the virus it gives you an account number to send money to, which is in Nigeria. When they get the money you get a code to eliminate the virus, otherwise the virus destroys the system. It's like they have found a sucker, me, as if there is an ATM machine in the cave under the swamp. I wonder if it is a Carthaginian virus.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_4">
			<text>Well Sid it seems like a Trojan, not the Carthaginian virus. This can be done by anyone anywhere. No shit, even on sites with pictures, one infected jpg could cause a problem. I suggest you download AVG or Avira or similar. Anyway I can help in the deletion of the virus. Throw the laptop into a swamp, I think your virus will not survive. Ha-ha!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_5">
			<text>Yes, that is very funny. A trojan you think? I have one such a stalker in mind who could fix this. A pharmacist, he collects different plant roots and soil samples. Anyway I paid him for a job, but he just ran off with my money. A little later I found out that he half set up a database for General Voronin, and then ran with his money too. But now I hear that a group of bandits in Cordon have him in their company. They settled near the ruins before reaching the bridge. Look there, then to the left side of the road. How they got to Cordon, only hell knows, but I think the pharmacist led them there for some reason. I don't know why?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_6">
			<text>You probably want me to go to Cordon and deal with all the bandits, see the pharmacist and bring him here? Or would you prefer I just get your money back?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_7">
			<text>Stop Scar, no need to kill him. Just talk it out with the bandits and the pharmacist. Give him a hint it was better for you to come, not Voronin or me. Anyway I think he may be pleased to see you as I think the bandits have taken him hostage. So after their death... err I mean... after you talk to them, he will be in your debt. Bringing him here is not necessary. Just talk to him and give him the transition to come here, and I will give you a tip for a Klondike artifact. It is not 100%, but still good info. Oh and do not forget to get info from him about the plans of the bandits. I'll give you a GPS tracker, sell it cheap, and enable it for this moron... err... I mean scientist... my map will light up like Christmas and I'll watch him.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="aver_sidor_haker_dialog_8">
			<text>You can be very persuasive Sid, this nerd apparently is the only one who did not fall for it. I must admit it, but you're right. So give me the beacon and I'll play James Bond in Cordon for you.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks_dialog_0">
			<text>Hi Bullet! Have you seen a big white dog called 'Bax'? I thought I saw it here a while ago. I need it to help open the transition from Dark Valley to Garbage.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks_dialog_1">
			<text>Certainly I've seen it. It is running aroud here somewhere. It and I have long been familiar. When it first ran up to me I was taken back a little, pseudodogs are rarely friendly, and I've never seen a white one, but we became friends. I was in Dark Valley for a while on the orders of Voronin, Strelok too. It helped me fighting criminals. For that I was very grateful. I give it food too. Did you lure Bax here?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks_dialog_2">
			<text>Bax came here on its own, it didn't like Hog. Drill suggested how to lure Bax out, and use it to disable the radiation zone. All hail Bax the hero!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_0">
			<text>Hello, nice to see you again.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_1">
			<text>I received from Barkeep and Voronin a transition to Garbage. Scar there is a matter I need you to handle!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_2">
			<text>Geez, what now?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_3">
			<text>You're not going to Dark Valley by chance, are you?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_4">
			<text>I do have some business there. Is there something I can do for you?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_5">
			<text>If you go there get my armor from a bandit. I cannot leave here right now. I'll give you a good unique veteran outfit as well as a bandit stash with artifacts. I'll put the transition point from Garbage to Dark Valley on your PDA and also mark the cache location. Voronin gave the okay to declassify this transition and also the transition from the Bar to Wild Territory.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_6">
			<text>All right. I'll bring you your armor.\n\n</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_7">
			<text>%c[255,255,128,1]I apologize brother! It's not on my way. I am really busy right now.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks2_dialog_8">
			<text>Okay I'll find someone else, but I'll put the transition location on your PDA anyway.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks3_dialog_0">
			<text>Take your armor. Most of the artifacts from the stash turned into shit and are useless.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="gar_baks3_dialog_1">

		<string id="gar_baks3_dialog_2">
			<text>I've seen magic tricks, but then again I must admit that you surprised me! Nice one!</text>

		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_0">
			<text>So Pharmacist you got into a little trouble here! I would have thought you would be in good company with dogs, bandits and other scum.</text>

		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_1">
			<text>Yes, how dare you insult me??? Who the hell are you wise ass?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_2">
			<text>Shut up dude. Tell me what these bandits are up to. If you think that you do not need me I would be happy to help you join your bandit friends here. If I hadn't helped you you could have ended up as boiled food. You understand me?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_3">
			<text>Really, which bandits, the ones standing or the ones sleeping?</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_4">
			<text>They are all in permanent sleep now.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_5">
			<text>What makes you think I need you? I've got plenty of other friends south of here.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_6">
			<text>The problem with your logic is that I am between you and the south. Listen you clown tell me what their plans were!</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_7">
			<text>Their plans are no secret to smart people, they want to establish a bandit's hacker network here. Why they came to me I'll never know, I'm a respected scientist. They made this camp since Cordon is the most convenient place. I could not refuse them because, well, they promised the same thing as you and that is death.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="atp_barman_dialog_8">
			<text>Well you can thank Sidorovich for your life, he sent me. You remember Sid who you ripped off and General Voronin? You took their money. Now scumbag to save your life and your debt he needs your help because his laptop was trashed by your bandit idiots. He's in the Wolf's Lair and suggests you go to help him. It's quieter there than even here in Cordon. The route to Sid I will put on the PDA. Take your time to think, but remember, alone you are nothing here but another unarmed victim waiting for the dogs to rip you to pieces. So thief... what do you say?</text>

			<text>Yeah, okay, I see that ninny now. You must have reasoned well with him. When he gets here I will give you the tip about the Klondike. After all you did do a good job in Cordon. Ask me about something else and I'll try to answer.</text>

		</string>
		<string id="escape_dimon_5">
			<text>Okay, I thought you knew. Semetsky was a merchant and very close friend to the scientists. Swag flowed through him like beer and urine. He loved to collect all sorts of stuff like, PDA's, lighters, watches, etc. PDA's was his disease. One day he was hit by a strong release, and it hit him hard, and later he disappeared. At first they thought that he was lost or moved to the mainland. But later one of the bandit stalkers said that he saw Semetsky in Cordon. The stalker said he had found Semetsky and announced it on the network. Many stalkers went there and the stalker who said he saw Semesky was dead and was holding one of Semetsky's PDA's. Then from the SMS there was a message about Yuri Semetsky was killed in Cordon by a Springboard. Later there were two cases of deaths in Garbage announced by SMS's. One was a neutral and the other a bandit who also died immediately after using PDA'a from Semetsky's stash. The neutral was all chewed up by pseudodogs and the bandit was killed by an Aspic. Where these deaths caused by some kind of curse created by Semetsky? Fuck knows, but stalkers say they do not believe in any hocus-pocus nonsense. The fact is that in some way Semetsky now lives and dies over and over again, and is sometimes seen by roaming stalkers.</text>

Die Gruppen und Fraktionen trennen ihre Signale voneinander und diese werden bei dir als Punkte angezeigt.
